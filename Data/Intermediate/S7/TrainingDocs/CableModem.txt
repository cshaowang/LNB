465	CableModem	POS	5	i be use this modem with comcast service . the setup be very easy , although in typical isp fashion the guy on the phone have no idea be be go on . i be able to set up the router with just a phone call , although they make i purchase they ` self-installation kit ' for $ 10 -lrb- i never recieve the kit in the mail -rrb- . but enough rant about comcast , the modem itself seem to be work very well . i have not experience any drop in service and my speed appear very consistent . i have not do any investigation into my actual speed yet , but everything feel as quick as i would expect from a docsis 3.0 modem . all in all , i be very satisfied with my purchase , provide it last a few year .
247	CableModem	POS	5	i have broadband from comcast and i have zero issue set the modem up with they . it connect right away and the comcast technician over the phone be able to activate my internet almost instantly . i live in san francisco and with this modem and comcast i be basically get the full 20mb connection , streaming be almost always perfectly smooth from netflix . do not have any issue set this up with my apple time capsule either . 5 star !

523	CableModem	POS	5	be run the sb6121 for a few week with a old e1000 router . i feel a little warm spot on top of the case , the rest of the box be cool , a little chunkier than the sb5100 , and full of perforation . have to call comcast before the new modem start work : -lrb- occupy comcast after repower the sb6121 , it take longer to reconnect than the 5100 , then it work fine . the modem 's web-interface show that instead of one download frequency , now i have four , thanks to the docsis 3 , although my download speed have not increase . url for the web interface be slightly different than the sb5100 , but if you start at the traditional 192.168.100.1 , you 'll get in . the web-interface webpage be very similar to the 5100 . slightly different light on the front panel . one day , i 'll look they up and see what they mean . -lrb- update -- on my modem , the downstream light be blue , which mean the connection be use multiple downstream channel bond together , else the light would be green to indicate use a single downstream channel . the upstream light be green since my connection use only one upstream channel , but it would turn blue if the upstream bond multiple channel . whether you connection use single channel or multiple channel be determine automatically when the modem connect to the cable system . -rrb- i replace my 5100 because it be start to have trouble communicate ; long wait to connect , have to use process of elimination to determine the problem be the 5100 . my connection be stable again , but it be the same speed as before . take the router out of the system -- go straight from the sb6121 to a computer , i see a powerboost of 30 mbits\/sec for the first 15 seconds of download , and then 13 mbits\/sec for the duration . i think that be about what i get on the old modem , too . -lrb- with the e1000 router in line , the download speed be only 12 mbits\/sec and there be not any boost -- bottleneck be the router . -rrb-
357	CableModem	POS	5	this unit take care of a lot of my comcast issue . i have six television in the house along with the xfinity internet . when comcast decide to `` improve my service '' by go all digital , half of the television in the house pick up very little along with the improvement by comcast , they infome i i need a newer modem to take advantage of the higher speed . purchase this modem and find out i do not have enough signal to provision it . purchase and install this signal booster on half of the service in my home that include the new modem and all my issue go away . if you be experience these same issue i highly recommend this booster as a crutch to improve you cable experience . very easy to install . the best price i could find be right here on amazon .

966	CableModem	POS	4	out of nowhere , i be have excruciatingly slow internet speed on comcast . the comcast tech advise that my motorola sb 4100 be at the `` end of life '' and that i should upgrade . skeptical , i purchase this modem which be a docsis 3.0 -lrb- and backwards compatible -rrb- modem . it work . i go from a 2mbp download speed to over 17mbp . what a difference . there be one installation glitch that you need to be aware of . when you hook up the modem -lrb- connect the coax cable , connect the ethernet cable , and plug it in , that be it -rrb- , and then try to get online , it will direct you to a comcast self-activation screen -lrb- no other site be available -rrb- . after enter my account number and phone number and hit the `` next '' button , i get a blank screen , and nothing happen . so i call comcast and they say that usually happen if you be do a upgrade ; it mostly work only for a new service connection . however , it be a simple matter to give the tech you mac address and the serial number . after about 5 minute , while he stay on the line , it come alive , no problem . but , here be the thing : the serial number they need be the customer serial number . this be only find on the bottom of the motorola box the modem come in . this be different from the `` s\/n '' serial number that be on the label that be on the instruction sheet and on the bottom of the modem itself . the customer s\/n have letter in it ; the regular s\/n have only number in it and be too long . my first comcast tech do not know that and it take a day to sort it out . other than that , it work well with my imac and apple airport extreme base wireless router . enjoy
292	CableModem	POS	5	i have have this modem for month now , and it have be great , no hiccup or anything , cant go wrong with this purchase . i see some folk that be say that it get extrememly hot , mine have be fine , obviously it need to breathe just like most electronics .
707	CableModem	POS	5	love , love , love this modem ! have a family who be all tech geek ... lol . okay maybe that be extreme . : -rrb- i buy this after the comcast rep say they upgrade to docsis 3.0 and that this may assist with boost we speed . i have the blast package with comcast . the modem be easy to set up but call comcast to activate the modem be a ordeal ... the tech seem slightly confuse . \*\* as a previous reviewer state keep the box , you will need the customer number from the box to activate the modem with comcast . once install and activate the first 68 hour be slow go mean we speed drop dramatically 4.5 download , 2 upload by the end of the first night we be at 17 download and 3 upload . by the next day it be back to we normal speed 20 down and 4 up . it have now be roughly a week and now we speed be ; 33 + downloads and 4.42 upload and this have be test from we laptops not a desktop computer so there may be some lag still there base on we older linksy router which will be be upgrade soon . my point be the upload time may be upward to 40 + download speed for a desktop computer and may possibly reach these speed through a update router for laptop or through a desktop computer be connect directly to the modem itself . i be excite with the result and the speed boost . we currently have 4-5 laptop , tv , roku , 2 wii , ps3 connect to at any give time and it work great . \*\*\* upgrade you router also : the only exception be access netflix via the tv and roku player ... it take a while to load the image thus be the reason to make sure you upgrade you router and it will resolve this . the image not load quickly be only due to the router and nothing to do with this modem itself ... just fyus . i have my eye on the linksys\/cisco 3500 or 4500 . : -rrb-
264	CableModem	POS	5	i install this last month when i have my comcast service hook up . so far get great speed through my wireless modem and no problem with my ooma phone service -lrb- 30mbp download \/ 6mbp upload -rrb- . nothing much else to say .
438	CableModem	POS	5	i order this so i do not have to rent a modem from comcast . i have have it run for a few week at this point , and it be be work very well with no hiccup at all . at first i have some trouble set the modem up , but then i discover that comcast 's activation portal be not properly load on my 4-year old macbook , but it work quickly and painlessly as soon as i plug it into my 4-month old windows machine . since i activate it , everything have run smoothly .
74	CableModem	POS	5	i have comcast internet , and activate this modem be not too bad at all . i have to go through the activation screen about 5 time or so , but it finally work . the modem itself be a breeze to set up , and it be give i a rock-solid connection . i be very happy !
342	CableModem	POS	5	i buy this for my cable modem and i notice a speed increase . the cable guy come by to replace my cable modem and even he notice a significant speed increase with he bandwidth measure device . this will save you lot of time when streaming and download thing off the internet , however , you might be spend more time on the internet since everything will be that much faster .
686	CableModem	POS	5	i be look to switch to charter cable internet service , so i price it out online and find that they charge $ 7 per month to rent a cable modem . so , i check what type of cable modem be require and it say docsys 3.0 . hit amazon.com with that search and find this . so , i call charter to hook i up with service , tell they i would purchase my own modem , and immediately ordererd this . get it the next day , unpackaged , hook up in under 10 minute , call charter with the mac address and i have internet service with speed upward of 60mbp down \/ 4mbp up all in less than 20 minute after open the box . the spec say it will handle up to 160mbp , so when charter get better , it should grow with they . have not have to reboot the modem a single time , like in the good ole day . the only improvement i can think of would be the modem be able to hook itself up .
985	CableModem	POS	5	before i purchase this modem , i do some research . i be not techy and be worry about buy something i could not use with comcast , my internet provider . i call comcast and they tell i this particular motorola model -lrb- any model over `` 5000 '' -- related , apparently , to model number -rrb- would work . i look at post on techy site . some user have report trouble with activate they modem with comcast . i , fortunately , do not run into trouble . i connect the modem -lrb- it be very easy -rrb- . i call comcast . i provide they with the serial number -- and the `` hfc mac id '' number . both of which be located on the box the modem come in . i be tell the `` mac id '' number be what comcast principally use to activate the modem through they system . so far , so good . it be easy to set up and be work as expect . and i love not give extra money to comcast because i no longer rent they modem and router .
824	CableModem	POS	4	not much to say except it perform as it should . i have to call the cable company to get they to recognize it and get it run for i . that take all of 5 minute .

865	CableModem	POS	5	installation be a breeze and the router\/modem work perfectly with charter communication . i should have buy this item a long time ago !!
844	CableModem	POS	4	i feel compel to write this to help those who will encounter the problem i face -lrb- and mention here -rrb- . i be one of the many people who want to avoid rent a modem from comcast and buy this modem base on the stellar review , only to find that on the day of installation\/activation that it `` do not work '' . do not work mean experience the same symptom that be be mention here several time - `` modem connect but then resets\/power cycles\/disconnects itself within a few minute . '' this happen to i on the day i activate my comcast internet . the technician spend 1.5 hour try to figure it out and end up loan i a comcast modem -lrb- motorola sb5120 docsis2 -rrb- , which come up almost instantly and activate just as fast -lrb- go figure -rrb- . he suggest i return this modem as it be defective , in he opinion . i do not like this since the probability of this be very small . but i see what i see and could not get past the first page of comcast self activation screen with this modem . before the web page for self activation could proceed , after typing my account info and phone number , the modem would conveniently lose connection . at one point i do get to the next screen where it be scanning for device , but the modem cut out thereby hang the process . the modem be pack up in the box for return to amazon when i could not shake how much this bother i and by my bad luck . so i come back here and read pretty much every review . what i find be there be several people who experience the exact same symptom while try several of the same modem . there be two review that stand out . one be from a person who mention the comcast technician moan when he see it be this modem , indicate that the technician be aware of difficulty use this modem . the person mention that after 70 minute of try to get the modem to connect the technician advise he to leave the modem power on and hook up for awhile and to try activate later . the person do this and be successful in activate the modem . the other review be from a person who be admirably persistent . he review talk of several attempt to connect and refusal to accept that the modem be defective . he end up leave the modem power on and connected overnight so the modem could `` download firmware '' . the next day he be able to activate after two attempt with comcast self activation process . lastly , i notice for i that if i leave the modem power on and connected but make no attempt to activate it via comcast web site , the modem retain connection -lrb- via indicator light -rrb- for prolonged period of time . it only seem to lose connection when i try to activate . base on this i feel something be break with comcast activation process specifically for this modem or perhaps comcast be intentionally make it difficult to activate this modem to convince customer to rent a `` reliable '' modem from they . to be honest , it almost work for i . after sit there watch the technician agonize try to get the modem to work , i be tempt to rent the modem and move on with life . so as one last hail mary attempt , this be what i do : 1 . take the modem back out of the box and leave the motorola sb6121 power on and connect to cable outlet overnight just to entertain the possibility that some firmware or info need to be download to the modem and that for some reason it take a long time to do so . 2 . the next morning i try comcast 's self activation process . 3 . every time win7 's network icon in the lower right corner of my screen indicate that a internet connection be establish -lrb- vs. exclamation mark -rrb- i immediately open a ie window and start the activation process with my account and phone # . the modem still lose connection when i do this but i keep on try . 4 . it take i about 4 try to succeed . each time i try , i start back on the account and phone # page . but each time it get further and further in the activation process . attempt # 1 : account\/phone # screen - -rrb- retrieve device information - -rrb- modem lose connection . attempt # 2 : account\/phone # screen - -rrb- retrieve device information - -rrb- list of device detect -lrb- screen show my motr sb6121 modem and a dtv box both show as `` inactive '' - -rrb- modem lose connection . -lrb- a thing to note here be that comcast 's activation system could specifically identify this modem . this mean it be in they system and they system be able to communicate with it -rrb- attempt # 3 : account\/phone # screen - -rrb- retrieve device information - -rrb- list device detect - -rrb- click `` rescan '' device -lrb- modem -rrb- - -rrb- hit `` next '' to activate then get to screen where it say `` activate device - this may take 10 minute '' - -rrb- modem lose connection attempt # 4 : this be not a real attempt because all i do be leave the web browser in the previous `` activate device '' screen and wait for the modem to re-establish connection again . i step away for a few minute and when i come back i get a screen that state `` device activate '' -lrb- and some other instruction that do not matter -rrb- hallelujah ! also note , no phone call have to be make to comcast to activate this modem . at this point , this modem which be lose connection all the time before , now have a seemingly rock solid connection !!! i be use the connection now with this modem as i type this . i have do some basic testing , stream video , surf the net , etc. . no loss of connection ! i do a speed test and i be get 25mbp down and 3.8 mbp up . base on my experience so far , it be in my opinion that this modem work and be as good as what the majority of the reviewer here have state . the problem lie in comcast 's self activation process which be suspicious . what do not make sense to i be the fact that modem can hold a solid connection if you do not attempt to activate and after it be successfully activate . it be only when i try to go through the self activate process that i see problem . i can not say much about whether step # 1 help but it can not hurt to try . i mention it only to inform people of what exactly i do . i truly hope this help people . amazon be top notch . this modem be now do what it be suppose to do with no issue . i 'll come back and update this review in about a month to report if it still hold true . i think it will but we 'll see . and lastly , thanks for the people who share they experience here . if it be not for they i would have return the modem back to amazon and go through the hassle of find another modem or give in and rent one from comcast . i be try to pay it forward with this review .
379	CableModem	POS	4	this be a inexpensive cable modem that get the job do reliably . i save money by use my own rather than rent one from comcast . configuration be simple . the modem 's only flaw be that it have only a single ethernet port . of course , you can plus a router into it , but it would be nice if it have a small router build in .
638	CableModem	POS	5	great little unit . reliable . cheap and all yours -lrb- no `` leasing '' the thing from you cable company ! -rrb- . i have use this in three install and they just work . they be great value for money if you get a refurb and very reliable in my experience . not much more i can say really . if you be look for a cable modem , this be it .
696	CableModem	POS	5	i recommend this product . save $ 5 \/ month rental for the modem provide by the cable operator and this be far better to what be provide to i by the cable operator .
730	CableModem	POS	5	have read through all the previous review , be a bit concerned i would have to be on the phone with comcast all night get this set up . not true . plug it in , attach apple wireless router , call comcast and give technician mac id , he say give it 10 to 15 minute , hang up phone - internet be work ! and at blaze speed , mind you . we have not think much about upgrade since we be not have any problem , per se -lrb- we stream music , play online game , surf , watch and record cable , etc - sometimes all at once -rrb- , but a friend at work have mention that he receive a letter from comcast state he modem be out of date and suggest he upgrade to docsys 3.0 . so we take the plunge too , since we could not recall how old we modem be . previously , streaming music would sometime have to re-buffer , netflix streaming would cut out , would get disconnect from online game ... . we blame the provider at the time but no more ! not one problem with connectivity since we install this ! one bit of advice for comcast subscriber - try to get to a tech support person . i punch in that i have trouble with my internet , that get i to a technician ... since there do not seem to be a straight `` press 3 for tech support '' option . all he need be the mac id , which be on the device itself or the box it come in .

825	CableModem	POS	5	works great . no need to spend 80 $ at best buy whne you can spend 30 and get the exact same function .
308	CableModem	POS	4	this modem be purchase to replace a ancient lease modem from comcast -lrb- surfboard series -rrb- that be start to randomly drop the link . the modem be select base on rating on amazon -lrb- and elsewhere -rrb- and the fact that it be one of the few three-star modem indicate as fully compatible by comcast . the only real issue in install it be to get through to comcast support to give they the modem type , serial number and mac address . after the wait for someone to pick up my request for action in install my own modem thing go pretty smoothly . pro : before install the sb16121 the download speed with the old surfboard modem be 14-16mbps and upload speed 1.4 mbp to 1.6 mbp . after install the new new docsis 3.0 certify modem the speed increase to 25mbp + download and 5-6mbp upload - very nice ! the front panel indicator can easily be see and give a good indication of the status of the connection with the isp . the ac adapter be easy to plug into almost any surge protector or up -lrb- it be not as likely to block nearby receptacle for example -rrb- and the supply network cable be of good quality . documentation be spare but to-the-point and informative . con : the only flaw -lrb- and it be a modest one -rrb- that i have note so far with the modem be that it be easily tip over . since the sb16121 vent heat to the side you do not want to block the flow of air by place book or the like to keep it upright since they could cause excessive heat build-up and a potentially shorter life span for what be not a cheap product . so far the solution have be to prop it up between a low-profile linksys wireless router this computer use and a small -lrb- less than 2 '' high -rrb- usb hub . this all might be no big deal to those of you with deft and sure hand and motion but i be willing to wager a nic or two that i be not the only goofily-coordinated nerd out there and the sound of this modem smack down on its ' side every 15 minute or so be disconcerting , and possibly a threat to the warranty . a recommend product for those of you whom want to own you cable modem instead of lease it from you isp and\/or want to upgrade performance .
999	CableModem	POS	5	fast delivery , work like a charm . save money since you will not pay $ 7-8 to comcast . easy to setup , even though there be instruction . highly recommend !
93	CableModem	POS	4	the product be what i order and receive it in work order . i do not know what else to say .
834	CableModem	POS	5	as simple a install as should be for a modem ... i replace my dsl with cable internet and be just a matter of plug it in and have comcast activate it , then unhook my dsl modem and hook it up to my router and a router reboot . it do the job and i have not notice any drop since install
356	CableModem	POS	4	not sure if self activation with comcast be browser specific , but i could not get it to pop up with ie . when i try to hit the web with firefox , the page come right up and i go through the step and be back online in about 5 minute . i do not remember the page off the top of my head , but best to look it up before you do the modem swap with you account no. . after the swap though , i could not get to google 's site with either browser . if i hit it by ip address , it work fine . i research it and nothing be conclusive . but apparently there be some issue with the modem and comcast . i do not want to be on the phone with comcast forever or listen to finger printing , so i find a workaround and just add google 's ip address to my host file . change my dn server do not work . i be also get quick disconnect and reconnect from my chat program that be never happen before . but it have not affect my fast downloads\/uploads that i be aware of . and multiple packet testing show no lose . oh , forget to mention i do need to upgrade my old router too because i do not get any speed improvement initially . make sure you get a gigabit router in order to utilize full potential .
4	CableModem	POS	5	get a letter from comcast say i need a new docsis3 .0 modem , so i look up what be a good one and this one come up ! very easy to setup , just call comcast first ! i try a few time to do the automatic setup , but comcast do not let you do it . it keep reset it every 3 minute or so , so it look like you can set it up and then it fail ... so just call comcast -lrb- or you provider -rrb- and it work great ! use this with a linksys ea3500 and it be a vast improvement over my old modem\/access point .
246	CableModem	POS	5	to establish some background , i have cox hsus and have be use this modem for about a week . i buy this modem to replace a trusty 6 year old scientific atlanta docsis 2.0 modem that bite the dust . i really like how the sb6121 keep my speed constant day and night . the 4x4 channel bonding help alleviate the peak time slow downs associate with a busy\/overcrowded node . on the flip side , channel bonding also help you isp enforce the cap on you subscribe internet speed . on my old modem , i would often see 30 mbps down -lrb- my advertised speed w\/powerboost be 20 mbp -rrb- . speed test indicate my speed be now lock at 20-20 .5 mbp throughout the day . yet interestingly , i be get 15 mbp up ; -lrb- more than quadruple the speed advertise for my connection tier -rrb- ! i guess cox be not enforce upstream speed cap that well at the moment . i love how motorola let user access the full modem signal and log at 192.168.100.1 . activate the unit be a breeze - simply call cox and read they the modem mac id and customer s\/n from the bottom of the box the modem come in . i will post a update review after i have play with and test the modem for a few month .
60	CableModem	POS	5	after read the review on this product and the subsequent model 6121 , i decide to go with this one and do not regret it ! i call cable one and give they the mac address to get connect , it be a snap . add wireless -lrb- see my review of the medialink wireless n router - 802.11 n -rrb- , and off you go .
455	CableModem	POS	5	i decide to upgrade my modem as the old one be , well ... old . i receive the modem , hook it up , call the cable co -lrb- time warner -rrb- and after a hour it be determine i get a bad one . i contact amazon and be send a replacement -lrb- prop to amazon , fast and no hassle -rrb- . this one work , and work very well ... so far . my upload\/download speed have almost double . so far it look like money well spend ...
111	CableModem	POS	5	nothing like go with the standard in modem , motorola . i be get 25mbp with the old standard docsis model now i get 34mbp . the blinking blue light when you router connect seem backwards since all the other light be solid when eveything be good but just something small no big deal you just need to remember that the bottom light blinking be a good thing but if the other blink it be not .
104	CableModem	POS	5	so i decide to purchase this cable modem after be tell by comcast that they charge $ 7 per month for the rental of they cable modem . i believe they rental price be reasonable , but give the cable modem would pay for itself within the year i decide to purchase my own . that be say comcast 's website be very specific on which type of modem they support and i choose to purchase a docsis 3.0 modem to be certain the modem i purchase would be support for at least the next several year . the motorola sb 6121 support all my need for upload\/download speed and be easy to setup . i only have 25 mbp download and 4 mbp upload from comcast but want to make sure my modem could support future speed increase -lrb- plus my wireless router support up to 150 mbp download speed so i figure the modem be able to supply that be a plus -rrb- . overall , the product function exceptionally and i be very satisfied with its performance and the internet speed i be get both wire and wireless throughout my home . as a side note , the sb6121 come with the power adapter , modem , and a ethernet chord but you will need to have a standard tv coaxial cable to connect it to you cable jack .
573	CableModem	POS	4	worked right out of box . make sure to call you cable company and give they the mac address and the serial number to activate it . then you just hook it up directly to you pc or a wireless router -lrb- which i do -rrb- , and you be good to go . no issue so far -lrb- only about a month into use -rrb- . i pair mine with a medialink wireless n router - 802.11 n router . this unit from motorola be quite small and very light .
261	CableModem	POS	4	i move from a rent modem to this one . it be easy to setup and i could use it right away . since i already check if the modem be compatible with the network provider -lrb- charter -rrb- , it might have help i . of course , i do not see much spike in speed after move to docsis 3.0 modem , but it might be due to charter not provide speed of docsis 3.0 . i also do not have the problem of restart the modem . hopefully it do not throw new surprise . ; - -rrb-
878	CableModem	POS	4	this be fairly easy to install but the first one i receive keep disconnect . after hour on the phone with motorola and my cable provider , i return it and get a new one . i have the cable company handle the installation and it work very well . no disconnect and very fast on the speed test .
57	CableModem	POS	5	i have the ubee d3 .0 cable modem combine with a  d-link dir-825 extreme-n dual-band gigabit router  now that charter have fix -lrb- or so we think ... -rrb- they pipeline issue it be blazingly fast - now we routinely hit 50 + mbps downstream and 4 mbp upstream -lrb- when it be off-peak usage . during peak usage at time we be lucky to get 1mbp ... if that much ... -rrb- charter guarantee 70 % of the sell rate , so if you be pay for a 30 mpb package they only guarantee 21 mbp downstream when the computer be direct wire to the modem without a router . this modem be fully capable of handle several future `` upgrade '' charter have indicate they will be roll out since by the spec it should be capable of a minimum of 150 mbp downstream and 100 mbp upstream . if you be rent you cable modem from charter or you cable provider , the ubee be a good replacement to save money . warning though - they may think it be they own device so be sure to label the modem as yours when you buy it and keep your documentation ! i use the  epson labelworks lw-400 label printer -lrb- c51cb70010 -rrb-  yes , we can remotely send print job directly to we home printer via we wireless broadband connection use the ubee d 3.0 modem and the d-link router mention previously !

170	CableModem	POS	5	comcast charge $ 7\/mo . as a modem rental fee . since i sign a 1 yr . contract with they , i figure that buy a compatible modem would be cheaper for i . after do some research , i decide to go with this product . i have have it for a month now , and so far , i have be very happy with it . technically , i only pay for 20mbp internet , but since this be a docsis 3 modem , i end up get about 25mbp when i be use wire internet . not a bad situation to be in : -rrb-

872	CableModem	POS	4	i buy this to bypass rent a modem from comcast . and im guess most of you be try to do a similar activity . ive only have this go for a few day , so i can not say anything about the stability . but so far so good , im get speed above what i be quote by comcast , around 25-30 mbp , when im sign up for 15 mbp . i have to have a comcast tech come out and setup my internet connection , because the line have be disconnect . the tech that come out say that this modem do have trouble update the first time for some reason . and it would not update properly to the service . this be mention in someone negative review . luckily the tech be able to split the line , and connect one of he modem to the line along with mine -lrb- this one -rrb- . in about 2 min it be able to update properly and everything be work fine now . overall its not too expensive of a modem , in a year it will have be the same price as renting , but then i actually have something . and the tech also say that they be pretty good modem , they just have this little problem when you first update it or set it up for the service .
559	CableModem	POS	4	set up simply mean plug everything in . unit be compact and work like a champ . cheaper than best buy . do not care for the fast blinking light , but otherwise very happy with the unit .

507	CableModem	POS	5	planned to move into a new home with my sister and need to consider which modem to purchase . i want to start the move off right with save money on the internet bill by own my own modem as it would be my responsibility to take care of the bill each month . i carry out a little research on my own to make sure i get the most up to date and compatible modem for use with charter . i go to my parent house to take a look at they modem but there be no brand name . they be indeed rent from charter though . i google the device model and come to find out it be a ambit now know as ubee u10c018 which be a docsis 2.0 modem . see as how 3.0 have greater speed and technology i decide i would go with a 3.0 modem . originally i be interested in the motorola sb6120 surfboard because of the review and its compatibility with comcast . i figure charter and comcast would probably support the same modem model . i actually couldnt find anything on the u10c035 be compatible with charter on the internet for the longest time . it seem that all the answer come after i have make my final decision ; which be the u10c035 . also , this link set my decision in stone : -lrb- ... -rrb- under the docsis 3.0 datum modem tab . if its on this list then its most likely support by charter . this be my first choice because of everything that i have read about its performance , reliability , and speed -lrb- 171mbp max -rrb- but at $ 90 + for a use one i just couldnt afford it . i be sway because of the price . its holiday season so i be lean on my second and slower choice -lrb- 160mbp max -rrb- : motorola sb6120 surfboard extreme broadband . thankfully i keep look . i happen to find a u10c035 at a pawn shop for $ 60 with everything include and it look to be in immaculate condition so i just have to get it . the charter guy come out and install the cable to the house which take they 3 hour . but when it come to the internet and modem everything run smoothly . i already have the modem and router hook up for they . all they have to do be install & run the cord , plug the device in , and call charter . it only take mintue then i be up and run hi-speed cable internet . i run the cnet 's speedtest and be run at 30.97 mbp down and 2.99 mbp on the up-side . mind you i be only pay for express tier @ 15mbp . we have 3 laptop , 1 xbox , 1 ps3 , 1 wii , and 1 netflix compatible blueray player run on the express tier @ 15mbp . please note that all device arent active at the same time and i understand that with my select tier i wouldnt be utilize my modem full potential . i dont need ` screamin-bleed ' speed . this work out fine for my sister 's and i. for i i just want to stay current with technology 's ever change tempo . i didnt want to have to worry about upgrade if i have decide on a docsis 2.0 modem instead ... apparently sometime next year charter be come out with another speed increase . i know we 'll be up to par and be able to accept the increase without have to upgrade we equipment for some time now .
883	CableModem	POS	5	have to upgrade to a docsis 3.0 modem when my cable company decide to cancel the grandfather 2.0 modem so i pick up this guy as i have always have good luck with motorola modem and this be no different . install without a problem and we technician be in and out in 10 minute . i do not see any increase in bandwidth , but that it due to have the cheapest package option and not due to the modem . would recommend .
765	CableModem	POS	5	i 'll make this quick and hope i be not jinx myself . this be the easiest thing i have do in deal with comcast . i lease this ubee modem already through comcast and want to just buy one instead . i originally buy the motorola sb6121 . i be sure the modem be fine , but i have issue in get it work with the comcast representative , ` course that be probably the main problem right there . anyway , i return it and buy this ubee -lrb- which be the exact model i have be lease -rrb- . i unplug they modem , plug mine in , go to comcast\/activate self install webpage and 10 minute or so later i be up a run with no issue -lrb- knock on wood -rrb- . i give comcast they modem back today and hope i do not have to fuss at they billing department next .
556	CableModem	POS	5	i love save $ 7 each month ... note : this do not have a phone port -lrb- you can only get those from the cable company -rrb- ; but most people should be switch to voip over google voice anyway ...  obi110 voice service bridge and voip telephone adapter

542	CableModem	POS	5	i buy this here on amazon about 5 week ago . we have decide to use comcast for ` internet only ' and take the arris cable modem back to the comcast support center . that be say , the physical hook up of the motorola sb6121 be very easy . comcast technical support be just , i guess , not use to self installer here . i be on the phone 3 night in a row with comcast technical support to get to the internal comcast network , where i could get the comcast url for activation of the modem . the thing be , by this point , i have give my new indian friend the mac address of my new modem several different time . aw well , at least we be make progress . come home from work on a friday evening , after spend the previous 3 evening talk to comcast support , i get to the same activation url at comcast and decide to give it a rest . after all , i have my new discounted premium directtv package to relax with . cut to the chase , by the next monday -lrb- 6 day after i start my change over to self installation -rrb- i be able to get to the internet ok . i find that i have to release and renew the dhcp address that comcast have give i and the new dn be quite different from the one i have previously with the arris modem . anyway , since dn be clear up and i suspect be add to comcast 's proxy to the outside world , i have have 100 % up time on the comcast network .
608	CableModem	POS	5	this cable modem work great with my comcast service in the bay area . i have blast service which be advertise to provide 30 mbp download speed , and i get over 30 mbp with this modem connect to my 4 year old laptop when i perform a speedtest on the comcast website . it also show over 6mbp of upload speed . keep in mind that this be the case when i connect the router directly to the laptop with a ethernet cable . if you attach a wireless router it will most likely not give you the same result but that be due to the wireless router . i get over 20 mbp with the linksy e3200 wireless router which i buy to complement this cable modem and i would recommend the linksys e3200 if you be look for a fast dual-band wireless router to pair up with this modem . as for the installation , it could not have be easier for i . comcast have originally rent i this same modem for 7 month -lrb- $ 49 i throw away in rent -rrb- so when the new modem arrive , i simply disconnect the old ubee modem and plug in the new ubee docsis 3.0 cable modem . when i turn on my firefox internet browser it divert i to the comcast installation page where i follow the step -lrb- you need you account number -rrb- and within a few minute it detect the new modem and i have internet ! simple as that , no need to call comcast in my case or look for any mac address . keep in mind that this be probably the case because i be rent the same exact ubee cable modem , but if you do need to call comcast , the mac address be easily accessible on the bottom of the cable modem . now 3 month after i buy the modem i have save $ 21 and i be happily continue to save with little to no issue in connectivity !
151	CableModem	POS	5	i like that this thing be gigabit and be faster than my cable systm . when the cable get faster i will not have to buy another router .
68	CableModem	POS	4	this be a great little modem , no problem with it at all , and i have have it for about a year and a half now .
299	CableModem	POS	4	i get the zoom yesterda and quickly install it . the product manaul be aim at wps config but not so clear on how you can enable wep . you actually have to disable wps in order to have the option to enable wep , which be not on the manual . i figure this out while i be wait on the phone to try to talk to zoom support . ethernet work fast but not so with the wireless . i have a big house , the tv be in the far corner when use roku with wireless , the signal be not stable . now i have to consider a wi-fus access point . i think my old 2wire 's wireless might work even better than the zoom .
307	CableModem	POS	5	unit have be work flawlessly with metrocast . call up to give they the mac and be online in a few minute . no disconnect or weirdness so far .
19	CableModem	POS	5	i have be use a motorola sb5120 successfully for a couple of year . recently i have be receive letter from comcast indicate i may not be receive the best performance unless i upgrade to a docsis 3.0 cable modem . i let it slide for a couple month but after the second or third reminder i figure i better look into replace the device . since i balk at pay comcast anything more than necessary i know i do not want to rent one from they . so i research various model and with the knowledge the old motorola never let i down i decide on the sb6121 . it receive good review online and the price be right at amazon . i receive teh product when promise and quickly install it . i do have to call comcast support to provision it . basically that be only to give they teh hardware or mac address of teh new modem so they could configure my account . less than five minute later -lrb- and a pitch for they voip service -rrb- i be up and run . first question i have be do it improve my speed . could be a placebo effect but i would say yes . various `` speed test '' site indicate better speed both download and upload . for the price i be happy . hopefully long term test will confirm my previous experience with the brand and it will remain stable and reliable .
375	CableModem	POS	4	i buy this cable modem to get rid of the $ 5 , soon to be $ 7 , rental modem from charter . i think i be purchase a new modem , but when the box arrive i see the refurbish labeling on the box ! i install it very quickly and it perform like new . i hope it last as long as the dsl modem that i have when i use at&t; for internet access !!!! i have all the download\/upload speed i could ask for with this modem ! i know amazon will back it even though it be a refurbish unit !!!
182	CableModem	POS	5	the sb6121 be a great update to the surfboard sb4200 that i use previously especially since my cable provider warn i that i be about to lose my service due to obsolescence . the sb6121 be smaller much better ventilate and look better in the black case . the price be good and the sb6121 be east to install . unfortunately the unit have a external transformer that add one more to the mass of transformer power my other component . the indicator light be on all the time green and blue . the flash orange connection indicator light be a little strange but i have get accustomed to it . i would recommend this cable modem to someone .
79	CableModem	POS	4	i would have give this modem 5 star , but the first one i receive be doa . i could not get anything but the power light to come on . the second one work perfectly , and i can tell it be faster . speedtest dot net have i at about 6 mbp down and 3 mbp up with the rca docsis 2.0 modem comcast provide , and with this one i be get 26 mbp down and 6 mbp up . i can not believe i put up with that so long ! it be funny too that comcast be harass people who own they equipment to upgrade to docsis 3.0 , but never bother to mention a need to upgrade to those who lease they modem . so far i be happy with this modem , and would recommend it to those who use comcast . just remember give the full model 5341j and to speak slow , and repeat yourself when give they the mac id . the call center be overseas , and there be a big language barrier . it take a few time to get the information across . also , if you purchase this item from modem land , make sure it be the one that be full fill by amazon -lrb- which be cover by amazon 's return policy -rrb- . modem land 's direct return policy be horrible , and would leave you responsible for return shipping , and a possible 15 % restock fee .
742	CableModem	POS	5	this product be awsome . i use rca and motorola before this one , and they can not compete with this one . the connection become much smoother and stable leave no drop-out . i be bit skeptical about refub . one , but with this price , the performance can not be beat . i would definitely recommend this product to other .
888	CableModem	POS	5	this product take 5 minute to install . i replace my exist splitter and my hd channel that be come in at 60 % jump to 95 % . i be receive most channel well , but cbs be come and go . now i get cbs and other channel that i do not know even exist .
732	CableModem	POS	5	we buy the zoom modem\/router . it take a long time to figure everything out and get it setup , but once install we be happy for about two week . then it start drop the signal and not connect . we call zoom and they suggest take it back , so we do . we try a motorola and then back to another zoom . finally someone tell we about change the channel setting , and now the zoom work great , very fast . info about change the channel setting : theinfopond.com\/pg-modem-router.html#channel
67	CableModem	POS	5	i know other have have problem , and base on my research it seem those problem be localized . this modem work great in state college , pa on comcast . all i have to do be plug it in and make a call to comcast for provision . a few more minute of configuration in the admin area for some custom thing and it be ready to go . have not have to touch it since . ca not really tell you whether its faster than the rental modem . i just do not use it that hard to notice .
160	CableModem	POS	4	... it seem that various isp be break fcc regulation and federal law by refuse to activate some newer modem , in a attempt to force user to use a `` lease '' modem . there be a essentially identical version of this device , the sb6141 , which be the `` isp lease '' version of this . you can not buy that , at least not `` officially , '' mind you . time warner cable have just have i on the `` loop '' for the past two and a half hour , and i be still on hold as i write this . they be tell i that the device be not on the `` approved list '' and thus can not be activate on they system . this , of course , be patent nonsense . all they require in order to access any device be -lrb- a -rrb- a device which speak the same electronic `` language '' -lrb- in this case , docsis 3.0 , which twc austin support fully , and brag about support fully -rrb- , and -lrb- b -rrb- a valid , unique hfc mac id code . the mac id be what allow the two device -lrb- the isp 's `` source '' modem and you modem -rrb- to talk to each other , as the isp need to know that the id it be talk to be a id which it be suppose to talk to , and they need to speak the same language . that be all that be required on any technical basis whatsoever . it be a violation of federal law and fcc regulation for a isp to refuse to service any device which have a valid , unique , and `` not steal '' mac id and which use a approve communication protocol . those of you who have be tell `` comcast will not support this '' or , as i just be , `` time warner will not support this , '' please realize , you be be rob , every bit as much as if they put a gun to you head and tell you to hand over you wallet . it be a crime for they to do this . i be currently on hold , with a `` customer advocate '' at time warner , attempt to get my personally-owned , legally-required-to-be-supported device add to my account . \*\*\*\*\*\* okay , after a long dialog where i quote letter and verse of federal law to the `` advocate , '' i get they to add my modem to my account . and it be work flawlessly . i would not ordinarily post thing not specifically about the device on a review of the device , but in this case , i feel like it be necessary , as some folk may believe they have get a defective piece of hardware -lrb- base upon what the isp tell they -rrb- when this be not the case . my ping time have improve ... which be somewhat surprising to i , honestly ... from about 58m to around 20m . i be not sure why that be the case , but it be a good indication that i have a better connection -lrb- lower ping time mean less delay between when you send something at one end and when it be receive at the other end , basically -rrb- . my throughput be much more consistent and level , and i have not see any of the disconnection error i have see repeatedly with my older -lrb- docsis 1.0 -rrb- modem . it seem to be perform flawlessly . if you have a internet service provider -lrb- isp -rrb- who have support for docsis 3.0 -lrb- the latest iteration of the modem-interaction-language standard -rrb- , this be a great choice . just be prepare to have to argue a bit with you isp , who seem , in many case , to be do everything possible to get you to lease one from they instead of buy you own . once they give in and agree to activate the mac code on they system , this will work just fine on any current isp , and will provide full docsis 3.0 support on any docsis 3.0-supporting network . do not let the script-reading `` support '' type tell you otherwise .
364	CableModem	POS	4	when charter cable up the rental fee to $ 7 a month it become silly not to buy we own modem . i buy this motorola surfboard base on good review , and after 5 month of use it have prove very reliable , offer consistent , reasonably high speed without need to be re-plugged more than once . it be only drawback be a few design flaw . note : other have describe this modem as nearly identical to the motorola surfboard sb6120 except more expensive and with a prettier but warmer-running case . normally this would steer i toward the older model but because some charter user experience firmware problem that turn they sb6120 into brick , i go with the newer model just to be safe . the price be still quite reasonable consider that after one year it will have pay for itself in rental fee . pro : so far we have speed equal to the modem we use to rent , and occasionally higher . it be easy to set up and only once have i have to unplug the modem to get internet working , although that may have be a problem with the router . it be important to note that unless you be pay big buck for super-high speed you may not be get d3 rate anyway . but unless you be strap for cash or certain that you will never , ever upgrade , it be not a bad idea to have the option and plan for the future . con : the sb6121 be sometimes warm to the touch . i would not describe it as hot . however , we have it free standing -lrb- not stack beneath something else -rrb- and in the cool basement , so it be not a problem . the illuminate led icon be easy to see but the icon themselves be somewhat obscure . it be useful to know that the top icon actually change color depend on the speed of you connection -lrb- which will also depend upon the computer its connect to -rrb- so if you get a amber light , do not assume the modem be not work . there be no reset button on the modem , as some version of this model seem to advertise . this be not a huge drawback for i . bottom line : for steady speed equal to what we be rent , a reasonable price in the long run , ease of setup , and long period of internet without interruption , i give this modem 4 star . for the minor flaw of chare more for a new case that run on the warm side and be needlessly cryptic with its cute icon i take off one star .
186	CableModem	POS	4	the product install fairly easily , except comcast could not see it - though it do not help to mistake a d for a zero on the id\/serial number when i call to report it as not work . -lrb- comcast have to `` register '' the new one and remove the replace one from its database . -rrb- it do not seem as hot -lrb- temperature -rrb- compare with what some review have say . i really have not notice any speed improvement , then again , i have not be streaming video or download a lot of datum , and most of my use be wireless which be the primary reason for anything slow . i mostly get it so i would be ipv6 ready , and for the docsy 3 . x -lrb- comcast keep call about upgrade , and they may insulate user from have to be ipv6 capable , similar to you router give you computer a ip that be different than the one you isp give you connection\/modem . -rrb- i receive it in a appropriate time . packaging be real simple . the only thing i really do not like be that the activity light flash orange -lrb- the bottom lead in the product 's photo -rrb- when orange normally tell i `` warn '' . i give the product 4 of 5 due to the orange led and because i have not notice any speed improvement . -lrb- i should have run a before\/after speed test ! -rrb-
288	CableModem	POS	5	i install my new motorola sb6121 cable modem today . the cable connection and bootup of the modem complete without a hitch and i contact xfinity cable -lrb- comcast -rrb- and speak with a internet specialist who take my hfc mac id number and my customer serial number off the box . after reboot the modem and router -lrb- wrt54gl -rrb- , i bring up the computer . at first i could not connect to the internet , but after i change my lan address it come up okay . the reason it do not come up right away be that the cable guy reset my router and the setting be all set back to the default . fortunately i have save my router setting prior to contact xfinity and when i restore they back to the setting i have , everything work perfectly . so be sure if you be use a router that you save you favorite setting before you do this modem change . it can be a real pain try to remember all the setting in the router that you may have change over the year . by the way , i never connect to the computer first . modem , router and computer be all connected initially but be boot in that order . so far everything now be work fine and i hope that continue . a bit too early to say how this will work out over time , but at least it be save i $ 7 a month for the time be . by the way , the xfinity guy be great , polite and very knowledgeable . good luck . update : it be be about a month since i write the above review and since that time the modem have work flawlessly . i know some folk say there be have run very warm , but i do not find that to be true . my modem be only slightly warm to the touch , but a whole lot cooler than a lot of my other electronic device . as far as i be concerned , this be a excellent modem and be work well with my xfinity -lrb- comcast -rrb- account . download speed 20mb and upload speed 4mb . ca not beat that in my book . sure beat the lousy dsl service i previously have .  motorola sb6121 surfboard docsis 3.0 cable modem

238	CableModem	POS	5	so i need to say first off i buy this modem for my new comcast service installation . before i have use the rental modem at several other place but note that my best internet speed be always with the aris modem i have rent from comcast originally . i do the math and determine that in the long run buy my own modem be cheaper than a rental , plus i could take it with i when i move . -lrb- college student -rrb- so i have use speedtest to see that although i be pay for a 25mb\/s connection i be get nowhere near that speed with the previous qwest and comcast modem . i be not happy at all . immediatley upon installation i run a speedtest and find that with my 25mb\/s connection i be get 40mb\/s download and 25mb\/s upload . this be amazing compare to the 12mb\/s download and 6mb\/s upload i be get with my previous modem . . now the bad , this guy be a pain to install . i do network management and computer repair and have install dozen of modems\/router setup . this guy just do not want to connect to comcast . i have initially have it install next to my tv then within a few hour want it directly hook to my router and desktop in the next room over . upon unplug it and run a line over to the next room i have hour worth of try everything from reset all of these device and troubleshooting . i eventually just leave it unplug for a hour or so as i be about to return the item as i fear it be defective . upon my return i replugg the entire setup into my network and it immediately connect to comcast as it should . i can not say this be optimum for any piece of hardware but i be happy with my new device and internet speed . i can stream movie and the such while play counterstrike with no drop in bandwidth or lag .

711	CableModem	POS	4	i do not know how well the modem work so ignore the star rating , but if you be try to use it on time warner cable 's wideband service in new york , this modem will not work . they rep originally tell i that any docsis 3.0 compatible modem would be fine , but when i call in to activate it the provision department tell i that only twc equipment can be activate with the wideband service . they would not give i a straight answer as to why , but i be fairly sure it be not a technical issue as this modem and the one they provide be basically the same , except they have a router build in -lrb- they give the  motorola surfboard gateway sbg6580 docsis 3.0 wireless cable modem  anyway , amazon customer service be awesome -lrb- as always -rrb- and provide i with a prepaid shipping label to return the modem to they at no cost ! so prop to amazon customer support !
517	CableModem	POS	5	when i get the cable modem i connect to my network and i be ask by comcast website registration for some datum , but i could not do anything without the customer number . and the modem be resete itself every time i send datum . so i get the web page and when i submit my router to register the modem get restart . i think it be in bad shape but i call comcast and they add it with a wrong mac address so i be plane to return it . it would work if it be no mistake by the comcast person add the wrong mac address . i read that issue in some review so i believe this people think there be something wrong with the modem , but after try again for a couple time the datum go through comcast website update the mac address to the correct one , once this be set the modem restart for the last time ! and since then i have not have any issue problem performance etc with it !
596	CableModem	POS	5	fed up with the increase in charter cable modem rental , we `` go for break '' and purchase this unit . as with several previous review , it be amazing that you take out the old one , install the new one , and upon start-up the charter software detect the new modem . the system ask for we account number and old modem mac , then take it all from there . a 15 minute install . ca not speak for reliability -lrb- just install today -rrb- yet , but absolutely thrill at the ease of installation .
257	CableModem	POS	4	the device be easy to unpack and the cox support guy be great . we have it run in about 5 minute . one problem that prevent i from give it 5 star - the print on the box and device for the mac address be way too small to read . if i would not have have a magnifying glass , the 5 minute install would have take a hour .
906	CableModem	POS	4	use this with wow cable network internet service . save my 5 buck a month . one significant issue however . even though the first rep i talk to before i buy it , say i could use any docsis 3.0 modem with wow , when i go to have it authorize with they a couple of week later , the first person i talk to say they could not do it with the number i give they off the outside of the unit . he say they computer be not accept what i give he . he tell i to hook it up , open up the modem menu on the computer and get i different number , or to call motorolum and have they help i , or both . which i do . after the call to motorlum i get some new number to give the wow people . of course , the new number do not work . fortunately this second wow operator seem to know more than the first kid and indeed , manage to make the first number i give she from the outside of the unit work . i do not know the detail or how , i be not a techie , she just make it work and say she be sorry for waste my time with all the other garbage and the call to motorolum , etc. . apparently this unit be so new , that the number on outside of the unit be not immediately recognize by they system as a acceptable modem and she have to manually sort of `` force '' the system to take they . i do not really know . maybe it be some sort of voodoo magic , but she make it work after some significant time futse around on she end . she say the 6120 , the older version of this unit be immediately recognizable to they system and she be do load of they in a matter of seconds . so , my advice to you , especially if you be a wow customer , be to get the damn older unit , the 6120 and make it easier on yourself and you wow rep. now it work just fine . so all be good in my little corner of ohio . it be just a pain in the butt to activate it .
916	CableModem	POS	5	we own a big house that be now a bed and breakfast . there be eight television and a lot of cable go to they ! the long cable to multiple television make for weak signal strength reception . the motorola signal booster be now provide great digital quality to every part of the house ! i be more than please with the booster !

647	CableModem	POS	5	very impress with this , and believe that other who be frustrated need to slow up a bit with they installation attempt . auto-configured and even act as a pass-thru bridge to my netgear fvs338 firewall behind it . take ~ 5 minute for it to figure out that it want to be a bridge when it grow up . on the other hand , when i connect a single pc behind it -lrb- \* and wait \* -rrb- , it become its own nat router . you just need to wait a few minute , and probably reboot when switching between those two mode . there be a config page if you boot with no cable connection at all , but i never even spend the time to figure out the password . the thing be literally plug and play . fast too !
539	CableModem	POS	5	could not be simpler ! plug it in and go !!! will also do 1000-base-t for blaze speed . -lrb- compare to same unit @ office depot for $ 129.00 -rrb-
926	CableModem	POS	5	it work great , it work well with comcast and be what they recommend\/lease out so that be perfect for i and it come out to be cheaper to buy it instead of lease it . this be definitely the cheapest you 'll come across so i recommend it from amazon .
367	CableModem	POS	5	i can not seem to keep a modem work for over 18 month , so i have be rent from comcast for $ 3 a month . since cost recently increase to $ 5 a month , i take a chance on this product . for only $ 20 , it just have to last 4 month , and then my savings will be $ 5 a month for as long at it work . i use a router and the modem install easily without use the enclosed disk . the comcast install screen appear right after installation , and it be the easiest setup that i have experience in a long time . shipment be fast , and it come with box with cable and warranty . i recommend it for the price and easy setup .
265	CableModem	POS	5	this be the 2-port version of the  motorola signal booster  so who need one of these thing ? anyone who be have difficulty receive a consistent cable tv or cable modem signal be a candidate for this amp , but first check with you cable company to confirm that they have do all they can , in term of get high quality cable and splitter into you home . if they have do that , and you still notice frequent outage of you cable internet service , or pixelated -lrb- distorted -rrb- image on live or recorded tv show from cable , then you may very well need a drop amp like this one . the amplifier be particularly helpful if you be splitting a cable signal come into you house to multiple room for multiple tv feed -lrb- and this be perfectly legal to do , per the cable act of 1992 -rrb- . any time you split a cable signal , you lose approximately 3 db -lrb- decibel -rrb- of signal strength . split a signal enough time and it can cause you to lose you cable modem feed or get sporadic distortion on you digital cable channel . insert a cable amplifier like this into you cable feed right where it enter the home and it will boost the signal enough to survive multiple split and , in most case , will allow you to enjoy a glitch free cable tv signal throughout you home . why be this amp 's `` two-way '' or `` bi-directional '' feature important ? a two-way feed be necessary in order to support a cable modem -lrb- upload\/download -rrb- and to support interactive cable service such as ppv -lrb- pay per view -rrb- . this amp will not work miracle . again , always check you incoming signal , cable and connector quality first . but if you have do all that and be still have trouble , this little cable signal amp can be a real life-saver . it also work fine for ota -lrb- over the air -rrb- hdtv signal distribution , but only if you be start with a decent quality signal to begin with . a full review of the motorola signal booster be available on big picture big sound 's web site .
668	CableModem	POS	5	as usual the company in phx be behind the time , i purchase this to use in phoenix but of course they would not support it , only a older version so of course i have to return it . sorry amazon and ubee , not you fault , but as usual amazon have awesome return make easy .

333	CableModem	POS	4	i recently replace my 10yr old toshiba modem for a linksys cm100 . the download speed be now about 30 % faster but only from those site closest to i here in phoenix . i be also experience packet loss which appear as if the internet keep disconnect . i call cox about the issue and they say my toshiba be to old to support and before they would review my circuit i need to buy a new modem . i learn while talk with a rep at cox , while give they the new mac address and serial number , that they cable network now support doci 3.0 . this modem support doci 1.0 , 1.1 and 2.0 but not the newest 4 channel bonding standard . there be limited doci 3.0 compliant modem available but a internet search do find they for $ 85 + . this modem work just fine but in hindsight i would have pay the price difference for a modem that support the newer standard . the final comment be that it might not matter that much as regular testing of download speed on my work 's 45mb fiber connection find that access to server even a few state away be limit to 3-5mbs download .
330	CableModem	POS	5	motorola 's sb6121 cable modem be one of the best cable modem available on the market right now , if not the best . it be a full docsis-3 .0 modem , but also fully backwards compatible with docsis 2.0 and all the way back to docsis 1.0 . in short , it should work on any cable system . it be future-ready with ipv6 support build in . i buy the sb6121 to replace a d-link dcm202 which have start randomly drop the connection several time a week , sometimes multiple time a day . installation be trouble-free ; just connect the cable and notify you cable company . -lrb- have the mac address from the label on the bottom of the modem handy when you call . -rrb- many cable user report speed gain on update to a docsis 3.0 modem ; i be no exception -- my download speed go from 11.5 mbp to 12.8 mbp , and my upload speed increase by 50 % from 960kbp to 1.5 mbp . interface-wise , there be not a lot to say . the motorola sb6121 's color graphical-icon lead indicator be much easier to identify and read from a distance than the d-link 's closely space row of identical yellow-green led . you can look at it from across the room and see two steady blues and one blinking amber , and know at a glance you be in good shape . this be perhaps a more expensive modem than some , but it be worth it , and you can not fault motorola 's reputation . it also carry a better warranty than many other cable modem . do yourself a favor and buy this oem-packaged version ; the shinier box on the retail version will not make you cable connection any faster . -lrb- but the chance be good that this modem will . -rrb-

343	CableModem	POS	4	i get this because my old modem that i own be reboot randomly and daily . that be kind of expect after 11 year of heavy use . i like the size and form factor of this modem . the light be not annoyingly bright , which be great because it be place by a tv . my first complaint be that it be difficult to get this register with comcast -lrb- not they fault -rrb- . it take about 30 minute to register it because the modem be not recognize the signal from comcast . it take a couple reboot to finally get it to register , but it have work perfectly since then . my other complaint be that the material that the modem be make of feel pretty cheap . i would just like to know that if it fall , it would survive . i do not think i 'll be test that though . move on , the speed be incredible ! even test it with my old internet package -lrb- 12 mbp down , slow , i know -rrb- , it would get a consistent 24 mbp . then , i upgrade my package , and switch to a bundle . now , i have 30 mbp , and i get around 35 mbp . so , i be happy with this modem . buyer beware : save the box if you want to be able to register this with comcast . they need the mac address and serial number -lrb- all number -rrb- from the box .

766	CableModem	POS	5	i be use the older iteration of this modem for many year and suddenly this past summer a hurricane name irine hit the east coast and cause power outages\/spikes and all sort of disaster . : -rrb- - the old modem be kill . i use this with comcast docsis 3.0 service in the central nj area and it could not be better . the old modem require reset and have issue with upload speed usually once or twice every few month . once i get this modem , i call comcast , they verify that the modem be support , take the serial number\/mac address and provision it . i be get excellent speed both download and upload - download be generally 55mbps plus and upload be generally 6-10mbps ... yep that be the tier i pay for . i have not have any issue with upload speed drop down and there have be 0 necessity to reboot the modem to date . my recommendation - if you be switch to docsis 3 and need a new modem - then buy this . also - if you be a cable internet subscriber then stop pay to rent a modem and buy you own ... the savings in the rent alone will pay for this modem and you will own it . 5\/5 in my opinion .
881	CableModem	POS	5	i order this to replace my comcast xfinity modem that i have be rent every month . when it arrive i simply contact comcast and provide the number on the modem to have they connect it to the internet . this save i $ 8 a month now and pay for itself . the internet also seem it i be quicker and i rarely have to reset the modem , unlike the comcast one . i have have this modem for a few month now .
230	CableModem	POS	4	if you lease you cable modem from you isp , you be overpay . this puppy pay for itself within 10 month , and with any luck it 'll last 10 year . that be how long i have my old moto surfboard modem . it occur to i to check with my service provider to see if the old modem be slow i down , and sure enough , as a docsis 1.0 modem , it have be blacklist by the company . turn out i could lease a new one from they , or buy my own . so look around the web , read some review , and this sb6121 model get generally good review . i be able to self-provision this new model use charter 's web-based tool , and within 15 minute i be up and run . hook it up to my wi-fi router , configure the router , and all my device have connectivity . so far so good . the speed difference be amazing . i be finally able to take advantage of all those bandwidth improvement the cable company have be make . even though i be still use a wi-fi n\/g\/b compatible setting on the router , the speed i be get be 2 to 3 time faster than what i have be get with my old modem in place . i have a apple tv , and since i install the new modem , netflix streaming be good to go . i no longer get buffer delay , and the video quality be always the highest available . this new modem be smaller , lighter , make more of cheap plastic than my old one , but be in every other way better . at $ 86 on amazon , it be well worth it . and if you get a defective one , like some of the poster here have , you can return it to amazon no question ask .
64	CableModem	POS	5	i be use the sb6121 cable modem with comcast cable . setup be fast and easy . plug in the box in place of the old one , and call comcast . the service representative know what he be do . it take about 20 min from when i call to everything work properly -lrb- include hold time -rrb- . make sure to have the mac address handy when you call . for this packaging , the mac be on the sticker on the bottom of the unit , as well as inside the cardboard packaging on the sticker on a paper strip . the indicator on the box be great . the receive and transmit indicator be bright blue if it detect a docsis 3.0 connection , green if it detect a docsis 2.0 connection . these receive , transmit , and online indicator be steady if connect properly . very easy to know the status at a glance from across the room . a note : on initial powerup -lrb- before call comcast -rrb- , the receive \/ transmit light settle on green , and that have i wonder what be go on . it turn out that comcast have to get the correct profile download on the box , and the right configuration setup at they end before the indicator be meaningful .
477	CableModem	POS	5	works as expect . excellent as a splitter and as a booster . i use only two out , i terminate the other two .
137	CableModem	POS	5	i be rent the motorola surfboard 5120 -lrb- sb5120 -rrb- from comcast for $ 5\/month . this seem reasonable to i up until i find this modem for $ 30 include shipping . i will make my money back on the purchase in 6 month . excellent deal ! as other have mention all you have to do be call comcast to activate this modem by give they the mac address . it be both on the box , and on the unit itself . this process take i a grand total of about 15 minute once i open the box . this modem have plenty of speed out of the box . in response to other 's get up to 30 mb\/s , this be not go to be a cap on the modem 's ability . this instead be a cap limit by you service provider . this be a docsis 2.0 modem , which mean it can handle up to 42.88 mb\/s raw throughput -lrb- include overhead -rrb- or more simply 38 mb\/s -lrb- usable datum -rrb- . for i , i pay for 12 mb\/s on comcast , and have see this modem get upward of 14 mb\/s , although this say nothing as to what the modem itself can handle . it be just comcast not limit i strictly enough to what i have pay for .
28	CableModem	POS	5	i receive the package yesterday and have this modem work inside of 20 minute . i simply unhook my old modem and follow the step to hook this one up . i run the installation guide cd and when i be do it display the ` mac '' address , tell i that comcast will need it and direct i to call they for activation . after the usual 10 minute of they try to get i to not talk to a real person i finally get someone on the line who ask i for the mac address and boom everything work perfectly . i then plug the ethernet cable back into my wireless router and the three lap top , a couple of roku 's , a blu ray player and the wireless printer all work great . i be not one to constantly check download speed but i be get some download interruption with the last modem so i want to replace it with a newer model . time will tell but so far i be very pleased with this item and for the price it be a super deal . for my application this get 5 star amazon be incredible but you need to be on you toe . i have this item in my cart and be ready to purchase it for $ 54.49 . somehow i delete it from my cart and run a new search and come up with this exact same item in a so-called environmentally safe box for $ 29.00 . there must be a catch . i have momentary buyer 's remorse when i be wait on the line with comcast but absolutely not a issue . no catch and i save $ 25 . remember this be a 2.0 docsis modem not the 3.0 high speed one . i do not pay comcast for they high speed internet service and my research say i do not need the 3.0 for the level of service that i have with they . so for about $ 30 you can own you own cable modem , eliminate the monthly rental fee and pay this off in about three or four month . march 23rd update-i notice that the price have go up from $ 29 to $ 44.99 since i buy this -- now only $ 10 savings
65	CableModem	POS	5	here be my story : i live in socal with time warner cable as my provider . i have 1 line come to the house that be split 3 way : 1 -rrb- strongest signal directly to the modem ; 2 -rrb- one line driectly to the cable box\/dvr in we family room ; 3 -rrb- the third line be split use this motorola signal booster to 4 other tv . it work perfectly . no signal loss at all to the 4 other tv . prior to this i be use a 3 way splitter i find leave over in my attic . it send the signal to 3 tv but when i add the 4th -lrb- pip on my family room tv -rrb- the signal degrade alot . add this and now all work perfectly . the power source for this unit be awesome . i have the splitter mount in the attic and run coax to a convenient outlet for power . i highly recommend this if you be splitting signal to multiple tv .
102	CableModem	POS	4	initially have a problem set this up w\/the usb cable & connect to we isp -lrb- comcast -rrb- , but once i switch it to the ethernet cable , it work just fine . be refurbish , not sure if we 'll have problem down the line a way , but for now it be work like a charm . not a bad price either . sure beat have to pay a $ 7\/month modem rental to we isp .
370	CableModem	POS	5	there really be not a lot to say . i need a docsis 3 modem and it work like it should . upgrade my internet speed , consistently get above 50 mbp down . set up be easy , pretty much plug in and let you provider have it be mac address . indicator light be easy to read . overall , very satisfied with the modem .
734	CableModem	POS	5	th be a wonderful modem that work well . i have some issue get comcast to add this modem to my account . after 45 minute of frustration with comcast , they say i have a bad modem . luckily my account be lock on they end , so they have to call i back a hour later . while i be wait , i call motorola and they service desk help i log into the modem 's diagnostic page . we be able to determine that the modem be fine and my signal noise number be perfect . motorola customer service be wonderful and i be able to convince comcast that the modem be good . i love it so far !
458	CableModem	POS	5	booster be easy to install and work as expect . allow i to add two more tv without interfere with my phone and internet over cable .
276	CableModem	POS	4	this item cause some deterioration of cable modem signal , as do most other signal amplifier . some amplifier even have warning not to connect to a modem . recommend use a two-way splitter in the input signal line prior to connect to this amplifier . one output of the splitter should be directly connect to the cable modem , via rg6 or rg59 cable , entirely bypass this amplifier . the other output of the splitter should be connect to the input of the amplifier and the outlet of the amplifier connect to the various tv cable . be sure to use a 75 ohm terminator for unused outlet . the amplifier work great on tv signal , reduce graininess , pixel freezing , and improve picture quality , on both analog and digital signal .
746	CableModem	POS	5	this zoom cable modem be connect with comcast and work perfectly . setup be ez and i recommend it . i also have another zoom in use -lrb- different model & connect to charter -rrb- and have confidence in the brand .
571	CableModem	POS	5	when my former cable modem die several year ago , i replace it with the zoom technologies , inc. model 5241 , and i have not experience a single problem with my comcast internet connection since that time . download speed , as measure by the flash -lrb- adobe -rrb- download\/upload speed test at the dslreport site , be typically 3.5 megabits\/second , but i have measure it as high as 6 megabits\/second . these number be probably determine more by comcast than by the cable modem , but they do indicate that the modem perform at this speed at a minimum .
580	CableModem	POS	5	i have 2 house set up with 2 different cable company , both of which use the motorola sb6121 modem . initially , i use a motorola modem with a 1.0 docsis at my florida home but internet service be intermittent . i replace the modem with the sb6121 and the problem be cure . when mediacom start charge a monthly fee at my iowa home , i immediately purchase another sb6121 and return the mediacom modem . the motorola sb6121 perform flawlessly in both florida and iowa home and that be the name of the game : reliability .
935	CableModem	POS	5	i buy this to replace a less than stellar motorola . man , i should have do this sooner . this be much faster . easy to install - unpacked it , hook it up , turn it on and then make a single call to cox cable support and i be up and run .
993	CableModem	POS	5	i recently replace the comcast provide 5120 with this 6121 , the set up on my side take about 3 minute , and it take about 15 when i call to update the mac address with comcast . in the last few week i have have no issue with this modem , the connectivity be rock solid , the speed be high and consistant , and i no longer have to pay the annoying rental fee each month .
488	CableModem	POS	5	install easy with a one time call to comcast and have be work great . increase my download and upload speed by 30 % .
443	CableModem	POS	5	before ... erratic reception since area go digital . after ... no more freezing , pixeled pic , absent channel , etc. . solve what cable company could not . brilliant . easy to install .
800	CableModem	POS	5	i have comcast -lrb- nee adelphia -rrb- cable modem service . bought my own modem back in 2005 i believe , and have be use it since then . finally decide it be time for a upgrade , so purchase the sb6121 after a bit of research . no problem connect it . need to call comcast support to get it activate : it take longer to find they number and navigate through the automate phone support than it do once the tech be on the line . once i be actually talk to someone , it be a 3 minute process : read she the mac address , she put it in and reset the signal , and i be up and run . notice a definite jump in my download speed compare to the old modem . only con i would say be the fact that the status light on the front of this modem be not actually label ; they just show various symbol which you need to figure out . they be not that obscure , i would just prefer label . other than that , the modem be great .
791	CableModem	POS	5	works greatly with comcast , just make sure install the driver firstly . the usb cable be not necessary . the package be easy to open and i love it . nothing fancy but everything work .
132	CableModem	POS	5	i buy this modem to stop pay a rental fee to comcast . it be a compatible modem with they system and have be provide i with the same level of service\/speed as the rental do . one strange thing : apparently if you give comcast the serial number , it automatically create the mac address . in my case , it be create the wrong mac address . if you be on the phone with comcast and connectivity be a issue , ask they to read the number back to you and check they against what be on the modem . i unfortunately have to have a tech come to my home but check and see if this be you problem before they send someone out .
535	CableModem	POS	5	i be one of the first to get a motorola sb6120 -- and be very much satisfied with the ease of set-up , the awesome speed , the functionality , and the workmanship . but , like all electronic gizmo , they tend to crap out after a few year . when my sb6120 start drop upstream channel , i look to motorola once again -- right here at amazon -- and find the new motorola sb6121 . after check the spec , i find that the new sb6121 model have the latest ipv6 technology -lrb- higher bandwidth capability -rrb- that be not available on the sb6120 . the newer ipv6 technology allow connection speed up to 160 mbp. , against the 150 mbp of the sb6120 . ipv6 be not in common usage yet , but it will be pretty soon -- and the sb6121 will be ready with the fastest speed available !! the new sb6121 be a super-easy set-up , and the connection speed be fast and steady . compare the docsis 3 sb6120 to the newer sb6121 : 1 . - the sb6121 be smaller -lrb- height and depth be smaller , width be greater -rrb- . 2 . - the sb6121 run slightly -lrb- average about 5 degree f -rrb- warmer than the sb6120 . 3 . - connection speed , latency , and jitter be better with the sb6121 than the sb6120 -- and way faster than any docsis 2 modem , regardless of manufacturer . some tip i learn from use the motorola docsis 3 modem with 2 different -lrb- d-link dir-655 and netgear wnr3500l -rrb- `` n '' - speed wireless routers : the sb6120 run coolest when mount to a wall or other vertical surface , and space approximately 1\/2-inch away from the surface . this allow a adequate air flow that be necessary to keep the modem cool . mount with the wire point straight down , the sb6120 run at about 95 degree f in a 78 degree room when mount away from a wall . temperature measure with mastercool infra-red laser thermocouple gun -lrb- available at amazon -rrb- . the new sb6121 be smaller than the sb 6120 , and it run a little bit warmer -lrb- 98-100 f -rrb- , even when mount the same way as the sb6120 . i suggest that you mount the new sb6121 1\/2 '' away from the wall as well , but with the wire point straight back . whatever you do , do not stack anything on any modem or router !! both of these device give off heat and electrical interference , and will perform they best when space about 4 foot apart , which keep the interference from overlap and kill the wireless router 's range . when you get you internet connection go , go to the motorola modem 's home page : sample snapshot of my sb6121 = cable modem status signal address configuration logs open source help this page provide information about the current upstream and downstream signal status of you cable modem . -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- downstream bonding channel value channel id 49 50 57 58 frequency 837000000 hz 843000000 hz 861000000 hz 867000000 hz signal to noise ratio 37 db 37 db 38 db 38 db downstream modulation qam256 qam256 qam256 qam256 power levelthe downstream power level reading be a snapshot take at the time this page be request . please reload\/refresh this page for a new reading -1 dbmv -1 dbmv -1 dbmv -1 dbmv upstream bonding channel value channel id 3 1 2 frequency 36100000 hz 23300000 hz 29600000 hz ranging service id 7425 7425 7425 symbol rate 5.120 msym\/sec 2.560 msym\/sec 5.120 msym\/sec power level 45 dbmv 45 dbmv 45 dbmv upstream modulation -lrb- 3 -rrb- qpsk -lrb- 3 -rrb- 64qam -lrb- 3 -rrb- qpsk -lrb- 2 -rrb- 16qam -lrb- 3 -rrb- 64qam -lrb- 3 -rrb- qpsk -lrb- 3 -rrb- 64qam ranging status success success success signal stats -lrb- codeword -rrb- bonding channel value channel id 49 50 57 58 total unerrored codeword 1457238562 1457238645 1457237949 1457238150 total correctable codeword 17 26 23 27 total uncorrectable codeword 1031 937 1682 1468 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- status | signal | address | configuration | logs | open source | help  copyright 1997-2008 it should give a snapshot of the spec for your modem . you will be look for 4 downstream channel that read snr @ 37-38 db and the power level at around 0 dbmv . upstream power level on all 3 bonding channel should read around 45-50 dbmv . a deviation of 5 from any of these figure indicate a problem . if the modem 's signal be solid and constant , but the power level reading be 5 point off in either direction , check you outdoor splitter or tap first , because they tend to crap out when they be expose to heat for long period . the operating temperature for splitter and tap be only 140 degree f. maximum , and that temperature be easily reach in direct sunlight , even when enclose . those of you who live in hot climate may notice that the modem 's downstream power level drop off 1 or 2 point when the outside temp get up to 110 f or higher . do not panic !!

945	CableModem	POS	5	works great . come with zero instruction or manual book , so i be confuse for a minute before realize that all you need to do be plug it for it to work . fast !
347	CableModem	POS	4	i be write this in late december , have purchase the unit in september . i 'll put this review in three section : the good , the bad and `` the neutral '' -- the good -- once it be set up i really have no complaint . i purchase a combo cable modem\/switch\/broadband router with wifus and that be exactly what this unit be and do rather effectively . since i buy this unit at the same time i sign up for the comcast account i have nothing to compare it to . my main computer be also connect through a `` ethernet over powerline '' set of adapter which add several m of latency so i can not even comment on that . both wire and wireless connection have be nothing but stable as long as i have have it . my apartment be small so it be not difficult to blanket it with wifus signal . i do not have a 802.11 n device so i can not comment on that . i have a roku box connect directly to the unit and it very rarely if ever drop off . when it do i know it be either comcast or netflix with the issue -lrb- s -rrb- . this unit do seem to have a incredible list of feature built-in . it be like the manufacturer just go through a long check list of every feature imaginable and dump it in . i have only barely scratch the surface on all the feature either because i do not need they or because i could not figure out how to set it up -lrb- see the bad -rrb- . i find out later it be fact possible to use this unit soley as a cable modem , bypass the nat\/router functionality . -- the bad -- if you ever want to actually use this device for anything outside of the default functionality put on you googling hat and get ready to spend some time : it be quite difficult to figure out what anything be just from the interface and the pdf manual have very minimal explanation of even what the various abbreviation mean never mind how to set they up . for instance i want to utilize the `` guest wifus '' feature so i could set up a old pc with a wifus card that do not support wpa -lrb- i want a wep along side my primary wpa network -rrb- . it be not that critical and i do not want to spend very much time on it but i could not seem to set this up . i be sure if i have spend several hour search the internet and experiment i could have come up with a solution . but this should not be necessary . either the uus should be intuitive enough to set it up , it should be document how to set it up step-by-step or at the very least there should a link some where on zoom 's site to a third party site that describe how to make it happen . the same go for use this unit purely as a cable modem so i could use my own preferred broadband router -lrb- a linksy with tomatoe firmware -rrb- . i browse the various setting , look up abbreviation in wikipedium . then i google those abbreviation . eventually i find the setting and successfully set up my seperate router -lrb- i find the real solution on a random blog talk about a different modem ... -rrb- . this should not be necessary and be not something 99.99 % of costumer be go to bother with . -lrb- the setting be call `` rgpassthrough '' . recommend disable of wifus , dhcp and nat , and put the mac address of the router you want . i never would have guess `` rgpassthrough '' . -rrb- i would also mention the apparent lack of any way to update this modem 's firmware . perhaps this be a regulation put on they by the cable industry but it just seem inexcusable to i in this day and age of network exploit and malicious bot roam the internet . -- neutral -- since i do not know who be at fault for this issue i be not blame the modem directly : it take more than a hour and at least two different comcast representative to successfully activate this modem . there be only so much the representative could tell i but it sound like it just do not want to talk to comcast 's end . the activation be attempt over and over again for 45 minute or so before it finally just inexplicably start to work . the representative have no explnation . i later attempt to activate a different motorola modem at the same location and have the exact same issue which lead i to believe it be not the modem but rather the cabling or whatever software\/hardware comcast have on they end . it be very , very frustrating -lrb- never do get the second modem to work -rrb- . once the zoom be activate it could deactivated\/activated instantly with no issue . it be just that initial attempt that be time consuming . again , this could be unique to my region and\/or my particular comcast office for all i know . i live in northern california just outside of sacramento . -- conclusion -- i be give this device four star for the lack of documentation and non-intuitive web interface . i like the list of feature and as far as i can tell be very effective as a cable modem\/broadband router .
305	CableModem	POS	4	the modem be serve it be purpose . i feel that we receive a quality product and the price be reasonable . a friend of mine be the one who find this modem base on it ' review and rating .
413	CableModem	POS	5	the unit work very well and continue to do a good job . i use it along with a linksys router
46	CableModem	POS	5	i be have difficulty view several channel after my antenna signal go through a passive 3-way splitter . the connection off the splitter provide weak reception on channel 4 and no channel 4 reception to a tv in another room feed through a 50 foot extension cable . after i replace the passive splitter with the dba-s4 , the reception be vastly improve . you need to supply you own coax cable to connect the power supply to the drop amp . you also need to supply you own f-type terminator for unused port .
982	CableModem	POS	5	i have a  motorola sb6120 surfboard docsis 3.0 extreme broadband cable modem  not long after that i move and the modem work again . . great must of only be that one place ... nope ! start to reset at my new place with comcast . . ok order this modem , which be use by comcast and so far nothing but perfect internet connection . i get 22 megabit dl connection , 4 ul . not a single reset or problem . at one point i do have a problem but it turn out to be my surge protector the cable be pass through . highly recommend !!
183	CableModem	POS	5	double my internet speed . easy set up but you do need to call you cable provider and activate the unit . im with comcast , give they the serial number off the side of the modem and be on line in seconds . very well make product .
381	CableModem	POS	5	this be the second booster i have install . it work so well at the other place , i have to get one for the new place .
634	CableModem	POS	4	this cable modem work immediately out of the box , set up simply and start work right away . i use comcast . no problem to set up . once set up , if you be nearby this thing be perfect . wireless be fast , wire connection be fast , all be well . in the next room there be a new mac desktop , about 35 foot away from the zoom and one wall . it barely pick up the signal . if you have a home or anything you need a real wireless signal for , pick something else . if you want a great modem that will be place exacty where most of you equipment be -lrb- e.g. behind the tv with multiple thing connect -rrb- , then it be perfect . i would still buy this , if for nothing else than the price for a good modem and a good router in one piece .
733	CableModem	POS	5	outstanding performance and value for the $ $ $ easy to set up and configure . fast shipping and low price compare to local store .
304	CableModem	POS	5	great product , double my download and upload speed . easy installation , only problem be with comcast argue about mac code since it be different from what they be use to . since i have have it no problem whatsoever . easy to see and understand lead graphic display . i would highly recommend it for gamer who want the top speed that they can get from they provider .
533	CableModem	POS	4	works as advertise . i would be rent the standard comcast internet cable modem for the last several year . now that i be not be reimburse for monthly internet expense i decide to checkout what modem comcast support so that i can purchase instead of rent . comcast identify this modem as support . i decide to spend a little more since it be already docsis 3.0 and can support higher speed if i upgrade my bandwidth . it take several time to get the modem completely activate through the comcast web site and setup process . i tire the activation process use chrome but have some problem . when i switch over to ie and after have comcast re-initialize the modem it be be work great ever since .
131	CableModem	POS	4	easy to setup especially if you be replace a exist cable modem . since i use comcast and be use a older motorola sb5100 series , i unplug the exist cable and just plug it into the new modem . all that be leave to get it setup be to call comcast and tell they i buy a new modem and would be return the old rental . they need the modem 's mac address which take approximately 5 minute and i be up and run . i have this near my home theater setup and notice the indicator light be very bright . you might need to turn the modem away or cover the light to dim the brightness . as for download and upload speed , i be see sustained 21 + mbps\/3 .7 mbp respectively . prior to the upgrade , it be about 18-19mbps \/ 3.4 mbp . so not bad performance but better . my only other gripe be the price . just realize costco have the sb6120 model for about $ 70 . if i have stop by earlier i would have buy it there and save some money since performance be about the same .
996	CableModem	POS	5	to decide which docsis 3.0 cable modem to use , 1st go to docsis devices mydeviceinfo on comcast to see what they support and possibly recommend by certification . for my money , only 2 option :  motorola sb6120 surfboard docsis 3.0 extreme broadband cable modem  choose the later , newer model . more widely use sb6120 be test only to level 2 . comcast claim to have test sb 6121 to more stringent level 3 certification . hope to future proof with use this newer model . have not notice , as other , heat to be a problem . install & setup be easy . help reading comment from user -lrb- comcast employee -rrb- with sb6120 . do not try comcast self activation web page since this be a modem change and not a new install . plug sb6121 into wan cable with nothing else attach . then call comcast tech support . change from linksys befcmu10 v4 docsis 2.0 to motorola sb6121 docsis 3.0 . comcast see device , send refresh signal . voila ! then connected pc direct to cable modem . finish with comcast tech support . take maybe 20 minute on phone to verify all be work . final hookup with router , in the mix , and clone pc mac address into router . do processing ! accord to sb6121 log , sw download successful - via config file , sw download init - via config file . mac address identified . light , camera action . houston , we have connection ! be it faster than what we have ? no. . why upgrade ? concerned about end of life devices for what we have .  cisco-linksy befcmu10 ethernet cable modem  prior version do . piece of mind to stay one step ahead of obsolescent technology . why buy vs. rent ? not fond of rent . will pay for its self in less than a year . try roadrunner cable modem then later try comcast cable modem neither of which would connect reliably . both have weak signal require a service call mean down time . purchase cable modem would always work . have own 2 linksy befcmu10 v4 docsis 2.0 cable modem . purchase for $ 20.00 each -lrb- elsewhere -rrb- when they be sell for $ 80.00 each , so have a backup . first linksys befcmu10 v4 buy the farm during a lighten strike . yes , even on a ups . the lighten strike take out the cable modem and a d-link 8 port gigabit switch . two router , in line for security , in between be untouched . now that i think of it , 1 router lose 1 port leave 3 more port to use . unfortunate but still a usable device . second linksy befcmu10 v4 have work until now . have sit on shelf for backup \/ book end . happy with decision to go sb6121 gigabit cable modem to  d-link dir-655 extreme n gigabit wireless router  and if we ever upgrade we comcast to 100baset or comcast upgrade to ipv6 , wow . i can dream !
618	CableModem	POS	4	the box say that this modem be not compatible with time warner , but i buy one on a hunch and decide to try it with time warner socal , and contrary to what the box say , it work -lrb- it be docsis 3.0 , after all -rrb- . it take a lengthy conversation with a -lrb- quite knowledgeable -rrb- level 3 tech to get it work , but it do work . the upstream\/downstream light definitely help with the diagnosis . accord to the tech , the modem be not request a ip address from the timewarner servers-even though it be synce . i even try manually refresh the ip -lrb- lan side -rrb- and it would not work . however , once i reboot the system on the lan side , the cable modem then make a request and everything work . strange , because the modem should request a ip regardless if anything be plug into the lan side .
760	CableModem	POS	4	many earlier review i read prior to purchase this state that they have to call comcast to activate this modem . maybe comcast have update they system because as soon as i connect it i be direct to a comcast activation site where i activate the new device in a couple easy step , within minute my modem be up and run . the set-up be easy and i could not be happier with the result . my internet be faster and considerably more reliable than it use to be . plus , within a year it will start save i money because i no longer have to pay comcast the $ 7\/month rental on a modem .

106	CableModem	POS	5	since i get cable modem service six year ago i have stick with the motorola surfboard line , which i will not criticize nor praise because both the box i rent from the cable company -lrb- and buy five time over -rrb- and the later 5100 model buy from a co-worker work very well for i . but towards the beginning of october last year i start experience major problem stay online and after a epic back-and-forth with the cable company that take two month to solve , i think it would be the cable modem that cause the problem . on a tech 's suggestion i decide to buy my own , but this time go with something different outside motorola . i could have get a few generic brand , but do research i come upon this model . since i have a linksys router , hey , it make sense to get the matching modem , right ? at first , i still have those cable problem . it be not the modem . three week and one pole check later , i find out it be indeed something at the pole in the alley . thus i buy this modem likely for nothing ... except that it work incredibly well since my connection have not waver outside of cable maintenance period ever since . everything hum along , the modem be not in you face or in the way , prop up like a small book on the computer cart against the desk . it be easy to maintain , the diagnostic screen be helpful yet simple , and since i buy a laptop a few month ago , it work very well with my home network . the modem also keep cool , the ac adapter be not a brick and the light on it be very easy to read . if you want a fine and dependable docsis 2.0 modem , this be the one for you . the savings of modem rental work in you favor and the small size of the unit make it very convenient to have , and it be reliability be impressive .

841	CableModem	POS	5	unknown to i , my comcast-issue atlanta-scientific modem -lrb- for the use of which i be pay comcast every month -rrb- be apparently the source of the ridiculously slow and painfully inconsistent connection speed we have be get . one speed test would come in at 10mbp , and the next at 600kbp . usually it would come in at 1.2 to 2.5 mbp - a mere fraction of the bandwidth for which we be pay . after a little online research , i decide to just try buy my own modem - it certainly be not go to make the problem any worse . the worst part of the entire process be just be on hold with comcast for 15 minute . once they get to i in the phone queue , it take about 5 minute to get the new modem up and run . but whoa ! what a difference it make ! the day before installation , we get we typically inconsistent speedtest with a mean of about 2 mbp . as soon as the new modem be up and run , we test at 21 mbp , and there have be no fluctuation since . every speed test report 21mbp . wow ! what a improvement ! skype video have go from frustratingly slow and pixilated with lousy audio , to crystal clear and clean . file download in a flash . and the connection speed seem to be very stable . if you old modem be let you down , do not hesitate to buy one of these . no ill can come of it .

197	CableModem	POS	5	i buy this modem to use with xfinity internet service from comcast . it work like a charm . i like that it have built-in wireless , as well as four ethernet plug-in . it be cheaper than rent a modem from comcast , so long as you keep it for a few year .

939	CableModem	POS	5	i use previosly the modem model 5041 over 5 year already . there be issue with connection at first time , but it be solve when i call to my provider -lrb- comcast by the way -rrb- . since then i never have any problem with this equipment . i would keep it till it die of the old age but on dec 14 2009 comcast upgrade its network so i have to pick new modem from they approve list of modem for 3 day before of marked day . i check review and pick the zoom 5241 . i have wireless router -lrb- linksy 54g -rrb- connect to my 5241 . what do i do for setup . 1 . unplugged old modem from power , coaxial and router , 2 . plug new modem 5241 to he power adapter , coaxial cable and router -lrb- with rj45 connector -rrb- , 3 . lunched internet browser -lrb- firefox or ie -rrb- , 4 . i get comcast page with instruction automatically -lrb- it would not let go for another until setup be do -rrb- , 5 . follow technician instruction -lrb- which not require any special skill -rrb- , 6 . enter my current account number and comcast show i all my datum include physical and mac address . i do not plug in directly from modem to pc . at first comcast do not pass linksy . i just ignore it and `` run diagnostic '' -lrb- which be just a button -rrb- again . everything be set up automatically . after too reboot i get perfect connection wire and wireless . download speed jump up dramatically . ps . one week later . zoom 5241 work now with renew comcast network very good . however once i lose connection but because of the my linksys 54g wireless router . after i hit reset button on it i get all my connection back . so it be a linksys issue . right now zoom + linksys work flawlessly . and i notice that download speed go up about 10 time faster -lrb- limewire from 15-24 kb to 200-500 kb - 250 average -rrb- . well 5041 be useless for comcast ip for today anyway but 5241 work perfect . i pick mine in fry 's electronics with describe above characteristic for $ 54 . good luck 2 year later . the zoom modem still work without problem . however , linksys wireless transmission become unstable . it be possibly that it happen because of em interference . i switch 54g to linksys e1500 . it work now so far so good . two month later . the linksys e1500 router refuse to work . i have long conversation with cisco , follow they instruction , and they agree that it be defective . so , i return it . ironically , the old router linksys 54g , which i try again , suddenly start to work without loose a signal . anyway , the modem be still on and never fail .

331	CableModem	POS	5	i finally take a look at my monthly comcast bill and be surprise to see that i be pay $ 7\/month for rent my cable modem . i take a look and see that there be a variety of modem that i could purchase and come out ahead within a year . the sb6121 be one of they , and appear to be on the higher end of the `` future proofing '' curve with comcast . switching to the new modem do take i about 1 hour as i need to call up comcast tech support and give they the mac address of the new modem . but , everything do appear to work properly and i have be problem free for a few month .
22	CableModem	POS	5	this modem will work on charter internet . i buy this product to replace my old linksys befcmu10 v2 modem since that thing be still run on docsis 1.0 . i just want to make sure that it be not the docsis that be cause the modem to crap out once in the a while . the modem would keep restart after the isp do a firmware update . just a note this do not mean it will import the transfer rate also i be not use gigabit feature from the wan connection .
518	CableModem	POS	4	i recently get comcast internet and want to own my own cable modem instead of pay comcast every month to rent one . everything go well have to contact comcast with mac id and serial # but after set everything up my modem keep cycling through and the comcast guy say my modem would go online and then go offline . he think i have a faulty modem and they be go to charge i $ 50 to send a rep out to check if it be a line problem or a modem problem . luckly i google the problem and find that these modem sometimes have a problem with receive too powerful a signal from the cable line and say a attenuator or cable line splitter would do the trick . so i have a line splitter that take the 1 line and split it into 3 seperate line and then it work perfectly with a less powerful signal . everything work perfectly now and the modem be great but i be surprised comcast do not suggest to try this since it be a issue that be know .
26	CableModem	POS	5	so all the review be glowing so i buy it ... i receive it the day they do the install so i have no idea the speed i would have have with a different modem . i do however receive higher speed from this modem then cox be sell i . i be on the 55down and5 .5 up plan and with this im get about 65down average and 7.5 average up ... so that be good . one of the best thing be in the month i have own it i have never have to reset this modem , always a solid connection . love it .
134	CableModem	POS	5	we replace we old cable modem follow advice from comcast and be not disappoint . we increase we download speed by 25 % and upload by 250 % . no problem with comcast service rep for authorization for we preformance service .
278	CableModem	POS	5	i have have this modem for about a month now . it work flawlessly . in fact it increase my speed from roughly 20mb\/s to 40mb\/s over cox . its a nice compact unit , and have a couple keyhole for wall\/shelf mount .
890	CableModem	POS	4	this cable modem have the highest compatibility rating with comcast -lrb- http:\/\/mydeviceinfo.comcast.net\/ -rrb- , so i be not surprise that it work fine with comcast cable internet . other than the led be a little too bright and distracting i could find no fault with it . whether you should buy this or not have little to do with the modem itself but rather whether it be worth it . you can rent a cable modem from most cable company for $ 5-7 a month . do the math , that be 11 month rent the modem for you to break even . consider that the docsis standard have change only three time since 1997 , chance be the modem be good for many year . so , if you be plan on stay with cable internet for a year or more it be probably worth invest in one . however , if you own cable modem die , you 'll have to buy another one whereas , if you be rent , you 'll get a replacement for free . since most cable contract be for a year or more , invest in one of these seem to be a good idea . just make sure you cable company be not charge you for the rental of the cable modem when you be use you own .
146	CableModem	POS	4	comcast be my inet provider and they send i a letter state that my modem be too slow to get the full benefit of xfinity speed and that i need to get a new modem . i call and be able to figure out that my modem be a docsis 1.0 cable modem and that i need to get the newest available , docsis 3.0 . i find this modem online and compare the price on amazon , better price and very good review so i buy it . good product , great price !
627	CableModem	POS	5	i never buy the modem on amazon , i buy it at staples for approximately $ 70 back in march but it be now discontinue . i currently have mediacom and i be only pay for 10mgb but since i have use the modem , my speed have double to almost triple . i have never have to unplug , reset or anything of the sort compare to when i have rent one of they modem . watch netflix , hulu and several other site have be work out very well . i would definitely recommend this modem to other . my router be also a netgear -lrb- wndr3700 -rrb- .
469	CableModem	POS	5	i have just install the motorola bda-2 and want to share my device hook up and result . my signal into the house be fine , but i have several split to different device and be lose signal strength . i have three television , 1 set top box , 1 tv tuner on my pc and a cable modem -lrb- cox -rrb- . my cable enter the attic where i make my 1st split use a 5-1000mhz 2 way splitter . i have one leg at the split go to my modem before the signal go thru the amp . the other leg go into the amp . i use two more of the 2 way splitter on the 2 amp out port . 1 leg on the splitter to my digital set top box . 1 leg to a bedroom tv -lrb- expand basic cable no digital tuner . -rrb- 1 leg to master bedroom tv with analog and digital tuner build in . this be the longest run in my house . 1 leg to my pc with tv tuner in computer\/2nd bedroom . this be a designate line , not my modem line . my result be : digital set top box have great picture , no problem with on demand feature work , the bi-directional work great . i be sure my modem would have work fine run thru the amp , but my internet have no problem so i split before the amp . bedroom tv have much clearer picture , all channel fine . master bedroom with analog and digital tuner be excellent . go from 15 to 32 qam channel all clear and some at 1080 hd . line to pc tv tuner be pick up excellent signal with both analog and clear qam . i be very pleased with all result ! there be a note in the box say not for satallite so keep that in mind . check all connection to make sure they be tight . check you splitter to be sure they be in the 5-1000mhz range . this be a a + product and i hope you result be as good as mine . update ! i do try run the cable modem thru the amp , but result be poor . the modem do respond , but speed be slower . the set top box with on demand feature work fine . i have excellent modem signal to begin with , that be why i split my modem line before it go into the amp . perhaps you modem will be fine . if not just split before the amp rf input .
621	CableModem	POS	5	this be a great upgrade . the setup be very easy , not sure what other be say that they could not get it to work with comcast . just call comcast with you modem mac address and you be do . now i be get 18mbps + down and 4mbp + up with basic service . delivery be fast . great purchase over all .
346	CableModem	POS	4	this replace my comcast router with no issue . it be not difficult to set up . acticate online folow the process discribe in the first review . easy seal , this thing be fast !!!
92	CableModem	POS	5	i buy this modem to dump the one charter give i initially -lrb- and be charge i $ 10 a month for -rrb- . set-up go smooth , though i do have to call charter and get a tech to help activate it , but they be very helpful , and say this be a great modem to be use with they service . now i have save $ 10 a month off my service , which should pay for this modem -lrb- and router i buy at the same time -rrb- in a year . we test throughput and with doci 3 it be great , so i be pleased so far .
472	CableModem	POS	5	work like a charm right out of the box with comcast , no setup require . the only gotcha be with my airport extreme , just make sure you turn the modem off before plug it in because the modem cache the mac address of the last device it be plug into .
528	CableModem	POS	5	great equipment ; use since 3 month now and no trouble what so ever . my internet go up and down very randomly but i do not think it the problem of this equipment , i try with other modem too . there be different deal on amazon for the same item , make sure you choose the inexpensive one .
423	CableModem	POS	4	i have try both the sb6120 and the sb6121 and the signal level and speed be the same on both . the sb6121 be a little smaller than the sb6120 but run much warmer than the sb6120 . look like they try to cram too much hardware into too small of a space . my sb6121 do not come with the power save button -lrb- it be list as a optional feature -rrb- , so about the only difference between the two model be the design . both the sb6120 and the sb6121 use the same firmware : label sb612x . so unless you want the different look led light and a smaller and warmer box for a higher price , stay with the sb6120 . as far as speed be concern : the multiple channel bonding on these docsis 3.0 modem be nice for sustained constant speed . it also make it easier for you isp to enforce the speed cap if they choose to do so -lrb- comcast in my case do -rrb- . i be get 20 + mbps down and 3 + mbp up on my old linksys docsis 2.0 modem , however that be the peak when the transfer first start , then it would taper off . the docsis 3.0 modem stay right at the 12\/2 ceiling of my speed tier , but at least the speed stay right up there and do not drop off after a few seconds .
374	CableModem	POS	5	i now own two of these . these be great device and i highly recommend they . the simple setup be extremely easy if you have comcast . one thing i be concerned about be that it run pretty warm , so i make sure to keep it away so it can cool off . wi-fi range be very strong and far , it support many device simultaneously and be excellent if you want to have a quick and easy set up . it only need a power cable and the coaxial cable from you provider forward to work with wi-fus , so it be excellent to reduce clutter . because this unit have built-in wi-fus , it eliminate the hassle of have a separate modem . you will not have problem try to get wi-fus to work with you modem since it be build in . it look nice and i would definitely recommend it . one time i have a bit of a problem with connectivity , but it be fix by just reset it and leave all the setting on default . unless you really need to change they , leave the setting on default and just change you wi-fi network name and administrator password .
440	CableModem	POS	5	i buy this modem to replace my docsis 2 motorola modem and be really impress by how well this modem work . i have mediacom and this modem instantly do channel bonding on the downstream . i have be pull 30meg down and i only pay for 20 so it be great !
656	CableModem	POS	4	i buy one of these baby because it be by far the cheapest modem i could find out there , and because with amazon prime , shipping be lightning fast . i have comcast by the way . it work great for 4 or 5 day , and then a major thunderstorm hit my area and there be a few power spike . the modem just stop work . none of my other electronic device be affect -lrb- include my router , which be not connect to a surge protector , my modem be -rrb- . i guess that the electrical current that kill the modem come from the cable jack , not the power supply . i be pretty upset , but i buy another one from the same seller the day after -lrb- 30 dollar be not worth the anguish of deal with linksys customer support -rrb- , and this time i get a surge protector that insulate the power supply , as well as the cable input . be run great for 2 week now . moral of the story : protect you investment , you internet depend on it .
983	CableModem	POS	5	i receive the sb6121 in about 2 day with amazon 's excellent packaging . hook-up be a snap until i get to assign the mac number with comcast . we try several time to sync the new modem with no success . i then take off my glass and use a magnifying glass on the mac address tag . i then find that `` b '' be really a `` 8 '' , and `` d '' be really a `` 0 '' .  so much for the golden year . have i read the number correctly , syncing would have take about 3 minute . we do a quick test and i be pull over 21.0 meg . i go ahead and buy the 3.0 docsis to try to be ahead of the curve . this dummy have be pay rental rate for year and should clear the cost of the 6121 in a little over a year . excellent price , free shipping , and prior motorola experience be all buy factor .
884	CableModem	POS	5	i have only use this modem with the comcast network thus far in the 2 apartment that i have live in this year -lrb- south florida resident -rrb- - so far , no problem , no hassle . modem have steadily maintain the always-on connection and be connect to my trusty  cisco-linksys wrt54g wireless-g router  upload and download speed be fine - torrent download fairly quickly , be able to stream hulu with no problem . overall , extremely reliable and a great value . it be a great alternative to the steady $ 5\/month rental fee comcast put in you cable bill for they motorola modem - and i be fairly certain that i have never have to do the `` unplug-wait-replug '' cycle to restart a connection - which i have to do a lot with the motorola surfboard modem that i have from they previously . highly recommend .
628	CableModem	POS	5	use a infinitv 4 tuner with windows media center -lrb- windows 7 -rrb- . before add the bda-s1 booster : signal level -26 dbmv snr 26 db after add booster : signal level -6.9 dbmv snr 30.4 db we have intermittent freezing & block on some channel ; those problem disappear when we add the booster . i recommend this for anyone who have low\/marginal signal level and snr .
329	CableModem	POS	5	pro 's : \* works fine out of the box . \* save i $ 7\/month in modem rental fee to comcast . con 's : \* do not cook i bacon for breakfast in the morning .
998	CableModem	POS	5	linksys docsis 3.0 cable modem -lrb- dpc3008-cc -rrb-  amazon prime offer a competitive price -lrb- since increase -rrb- . the order arrive on time along with another amazon order place later that arrive a day early . if you be a basic internet service consumer , you probably be not shop for a docsis 3.0 cable modem . if you want the best `` bang for you buck '' and need fast internet access say for video on demand or online gaming , read on . bottom line , this cisco dpc3800-cc cable modem work on my comcast service . it do not operate at docsis 3.0 speed . my quantifiable thru put be now more than double by replace a lease docsis 2 cable modem with this docsis 3 modem . the pay back be 12.2 month by eliminate the comcast modem lease . my disappointment rest with comcast , not this product . here be why . while the fcc want us isp to make 100 million bit per second -lrb- 100 mbp -rrb- download speed we national standard by 2020 , we be far from that standard in 2012 . a cable internet provider that implement the full feature set of the cable industry 's docsis 3.0 standard could meet the fcc objective . but my service provider be not even close and have no incentive to do so . all we can do , as consumer foot the bill , be to be inform -lrb- search `` docsis 3.0 '' -rrb- and purchase product that will work if the service level be provide . you need to understand that there be three variable to you quality of internet service : 1 -rrb- cooperative manufacturer \/ service provider relationship to assure proper `` provision '' or the ` hand shake ' between the hardware and the isp ; 2 -rrb- a isp willing to implement a supportive infrastructure ; and 3 -rrb- the isp service level and equipment you select to pay for . i choose the cisco dpc3008-cc to address factor 1 and 3 and understand that comcast be not now provide adequate service to my location to achieve service level this cable modem be design to provide . in other word , i can not downgrade the dpc3008 device due to my isp service , factor 2 ! i move from nw fl to sw florida a few month ago in 2012 . with the same hardware -lrb- a docsis 2 scientific atlanta cable modem -rrb- , different cable provider -lrb- cox & comcast -rrb- i have 2x faster thru put with cox cable than i now have with comcast with the same modem . a personal visit to comcast 's local service office confirm yesterday that my location be not receive the highest speed comcast offer here . in contrast , i receive better than advertise thru put from cox -lrb- try 32 mbp with the same docsis 2 device ! -rrb- . the installation be simple . the cd base user guide be not clear . yes , you can just attach the new cable modem to you cable without waste time to call technical support , assume you cable internet be operable . keep you work cable modem until you set up you new one . as per the user guide , simply connect the new modem and power it up . observe the light to confirm the new modem on you cable initiate you isp 's automatic provision . now , direct connect you computer to the modem , power cycle the modem and open you browser . you eventually will see a screen that request you account number and register phone number , maybe the last 4 digit of you ssno . after a reset , i be good to go . the last install step be to then connect you wire \/ wireless local area network . you can do this within 30 minute . after testing that , i drive to comcast , turn in the lease cable modem and challenge they service level to no avail . i will edit this review later if i experience any issue specific to the cisco dpc3008-cc . i conclude that the negative review here be from inexperienced user or perhaps a firmware or provision issue now correct by comcast and cisco . after 24 hour , it be still work and never reboot . if a user do not properly `` provision '' the new modem with the isp , it will exhibit the reboot symptom complain about here . i deduce that the comcast recommend speed test site -lrb- speedtest.net -rrb- be optimize for my local comcast service since its measure speed with two different cable modem be nearly twice that of a different site -lrb- speakeasy.net -rrb- . within 24 hour , i run 4 test of the two different site . with speedtest.net , my download \/ upload average speed be 15.4 \/ 6.2 mbit\/sec with the doci 2 device versus 28.4 \/ 5.3 with the cisco docsis dpc3800 . with speakeasy.net , the average be 7.0 \/ 6.0 before versus 28.4 \/ 4.0 with the cisco modem . clearly , the cisco dpc3008 docsis 3 cable modem perform better than a scientific atlanta docsis 2 cable modem . be the expect docsis 3 speed attain ? no. . if you read all the above , you understand that i hold comcast accountable , not this device from cisco . be i obtain the docsis 3 benefit of 8\/4 dynamic channel bonding ? there be no way to tell , except my speed test suggest no. . i do not now know if that be hardware or a isp issue . yes i be receive the docsis 3.0 benefit of ipv6 and a gigabit ethernet port . yes , the setup be easy . i choose the cisco dpc3008 primarily due to its docsis 3.0 certification and its acceptance as a approve device by comcast . comcast have few docsis 3.0 device on its approval list that be still market by the manufacturer for consumer purchase with the 8 \/ 4 channel bonding and ipv6 feature of docsis 3 . the newer cisco dpc3010 and newer device from several manufacture be not yet approve so i stick with the older dpc3008 . why comcast seem to need 4 year to certify a device , six year after docsis 3 be define be unfathomable . cisco seem to have go the extra mile to assure its device be acceptable to comcast , factor 1 above . this specific cable modem be my best available option today and it work .
431	CableModem	POS	5	i have opportunity to test two different cable modem on comcast business service . one be motorola sb6121 and the other zoom 5341 . both be docsis 3.0 , which be require for high speed cable service . comcast tech support be not thrill about zoom while they praise motorola surfboard high . as it turn out , average comcast technician , who suppose to activate the modem , have a trouble with the zoom serial number . my configuration of comcast service in this case be 2 time 50 mb\/s download and 10 mb\/s upload speed . this service suppose to supply over 1000 user with internet access , load balance mode . first line be activate with zoom modem and everything go well for several day . to the second line i attach motorola modem ; comcast manage to deactivate zoom modem on the first line in process , though . initial test of motorola show expect value in download and upload speed . however , with network connect to it , motorola download speed do not reach more than 10 mb\/s download with upload of 2 mb\/s . after 24 hour of 1000 people complain , comcast technician come to check the installation and re-activate zoom modem . test of motorola modem with a single laptop connect do not show any abnormality : download and upload speed be at nominal value . since i could not put in place my load balancer yet , i switch the network to the zoom modem and make 1000 surfer happy again . in a couple of day my load balance configuration should go live , use one motorola and one zoom modem . i intend to update this review with the result of motorola performance in this configuration , for potential buyer interested in the motorola sb6121 . well , i decide to buy comcast internet service for home and i do not have dilemma which modem to choose ; zoom it be . i order on-site installation because my cable coax have to be replace and expect confusion with zoom serial number -lrb- that happen as expect , too -rrb- . anyway , comcast get it online and my modem be happily blinking , ever after -lrb- two week in service -rrb- . the one order here have slightly different housing than the first one i deal with -lrb- buy at microcenter -rrb- ; i assume that zoom make a change in design and this one do not get as warm -lrb- as the other one -rrb- . price difference between zoom and motorola on amazon be not worth mention ; while motorola be a big name in communication equipment i feel more comfortable for go with zoom this time .
778	CableModem	POS	4	do not have any problem set it up . you should make sure with you cable company that they system be compatible to work with this modem . not a bad price if you do not have time to shop on ebay . happy with the buy .

835	CableModem	POS	4	very easy to setup out of the box but documentation a bit lack in explanation of configuration and feature . i guess it be assume you already know how to configure you modem . i do have a problem with a older hp\/compaq laptop run m vista . it would not connect to internet use wpa or psk , try every thing i read in variuo blog but nothing work . discover there be a update for the atheros wifi adapter , download and install it - connect perfectly now . very fast 20mb download speed . very please with product .

990	CableModem	POS	5	replace a old linksy that finally die . this modem perform well , provide stable service and speed . we use comcast\/infinity isp . glad i choose this one .
937	CableModem	POS	5	just want to send a warn out there for people like i who be not tech savvy with modem - i find out the hard and long way that this modem will not work if you have comcast internet and telephone . it only have a cable jack and a ethernet jack -lrb- the ethernet cable be the cable that run from you computer or router to the modem -rrb- . for comcast voice , you need a telephony cable modem that have a cable jack , ethernet jack , and a phone jack . i discover after a visit to fry that 99.9 % of the cable modem do not have phone jack - 3 of the 4 salespeople i speak with have never even hear of one have a phone jack . however , the best buy that have a comcast installation center in they do sell the special telephony cable modem -lrb- brand be arris -rrb- , but it cost $ 150 . i be sure i could have find one cheaper online , but i be pretty do with it by then . the rental fee for the arris modem through comcast be $ 7 a month . it would take over 21 month of rental fee to pay off the $ 150 price , and by then something new would be on the market . so i just bite the bullet and rent from comcast . hope this info save someone else a day of frustration .
666	CableModem	POS	5	the cable signal enter my house be somehwat low power -lrb- we live at the end of a long line -rrb- , then it get split 2 way to a cable modem and a main distribution amp , each get -9 db of signal -lrb- per the cable modem diag page -rrb- . then one of the leg from that da get split another four way . the line directly off the da have a okay digital and analog signal . the line off the 4 way splitter have a rather noisy analog signal but no digital tv would detect any of the digital channel , much less attempt to pixelate . i connect this amp just before the initial 2-way splitter . the cable modem indicate +3 db and the snr of the digital signal be improve on the line directly off the da -lrb- although there be no visual difference of course -rrb- . the line off the 4-way splitter now have a very clear analog signal as well as sufficiently high signal to receive the digital channel . excellent amplifier and easy to install . the retail version may include a coax cable for power , but this one do not but it provide for remote power if you want to put it even closer to the pole -lrb- the closer the better , so you be not amplify the noise too -rrb- -lrb- you 'll need a power insert to do this -rrb- .
63	CableModem	POS	5	i recently have to install tuning adapter for my tivo box in order to receive certain high definition channel from time warner . these adapter drop the signal down from around 93 to 44 as measure by the tivo signal strength function . i have a passive 4:1 splitter in the attic which work fine until these adapter be install . after the tuning adapter be install some of the channel would get the dreaded digital signal drop-out . i install this signal booster which take about 15 minute - most of which be just to tie the cable back neatly . now i have 90 to 100 signal level on all of my tivo box and the picture quality be great . i do not use this on my internet connection as it be run separately from my other cable . product feel very solid and well build . i have only have it a couple of week , so can not comment on the long term reliability , but so far it be a great little unit .
508	CableModem	POS	5	great product . work as advertised right out of box . have to contact comcast to activate it and deactivate my rental box . i be pretty computer capable , but i do not encounter anything a non-techie could not work through .
657	CableModem	POS	5	because they can not make enough profit off i , tw cable start charge i $ 5 for rental of a modem they have give i for free for 6 year . it be a slight upgrade from the one i replace , although you can not really tell it from the performance . i plug it in , call tw to let they know -lrb- they have to do something in they office to get it recognize by the network -rrb- and i go right back to work on my computer .
880	CableModem	POS	4	i purchase this particular modem base on some on-line research . my old modem be a docsis 1.0 modem therefore limit to 12mp of download . i decide to upgrade to a docsis 2.0 modem to gain more speed . this modem fit the bill as far as speed and value . i have be use it for over a month and it have function normally . i have use other linksys product and be very satisfied with this modem .
694	CableModem	POS	5	replace a comcast scientific atlantic modem -lrb- lease for $ 7 per month ... -rrb- with this docsis 3.0 modem which be the highest recommend and certify on the comcast site -lrb- https:\/\/customer.comcast.com\/help-and-support\/internet\/list-of-approved-cable-modems\/ -rrb- . my speed be now 20mbps d\/l and 4mbp u\/l -lrb- base on speakeasy\/speedtest which i understand may not be the most reliable -rrb- . i be happy with that since i only subscribe to the `` performance starter '' level of internet service from comcast\/xfinity -lrb- $ 45.95 \/ mo in ag , georgia . -rrb- . so at the former $ 7 per month lease , this cable modem will pay for itself within a year . it have be quite reliable and my only reservation be the amount of heat it generate relative to the previous , smaller-size cable modem .
687	CableModem	POS	4	i buy this motorola bda-s1 and the pct amp to try head to head . btw , the pct amp be also sell as a channel master product . the specification of the pct and motorola amp be so similar that it seem likely that they both contain the same integrated circuit .  pct 1-port bi-directional cable tv hdtv amplifier signal booster with passive return path  however , nothing be inside of either product except one integrate circuit chip , so neither product be really superior to the other in that regard . the enclosure on the pct be perfectly adequate . swap out the motorola and pct amp a few time , i find that they perform identically on all station , whether strong , extremely weak , or middle of the road . both amp clean up the glitch on all of the station that i expect to receive in pristine condition . both amp allow i to add one low power analog station that i could not receive without a amp . neither amp cause any degradation to the quality of any station . both amp produce identical signal strength on all channel as measure by the on-screen signal strength meter of my plasma . the short story be that i have give the pct amp five star . this motorola bda-s1 get four star for deliver the same excellent performance but at a higher price . read on if you be interested in the condition of the comparison . if not , you be do . i drop comcast as of june 1 in favor of broadcast hdtv and netflix streaming . my antenna farm be located in the loft of a detach garage . currently , my uhf antenna be the primary antenna , augment by two vhf antenna that only receive one channel each .  winegard hd9095p uhf high-gain 39-element hdtv antenna  the two vhf antenna be join in a  monster standard rf splitters for catv signal mkii - 2 way rf splitter  as the system have grow , i find that i need to add a antenna amp . the detach garage do not have electricity , so each amp be use in remotely power mode . the amp be test be place just after the blonder-tongue zuvsj in the garage use a one foot jumper . neither amp include a power inserter , so the remote power be provide by use a pico-macom hlsj as a power inserter from inside the basement of the house . i have 100 foot of quad shield between the power inserter and the amp . during the testing , i also have 25 foot of quad shield from the power inserter to the plasma . finally , pay no attention to the genius who insist that product like the pct and bda-s1 signal amplifier can not be use with broadcast hdtv signal . a good rf amp be a good rf amp . both product cover the entire broadcast tv spectrum and then some , and both have a input noise figure of about 2.5 db . both product deliver exceptional performance as antenna amp , exactly as they specification would suggest . true , neither product be package for direct exposure to precipitation , but that be a entirely different matter from say that they only work on cable tv . there be a lot of really bad advice in these customer review .
981	CableModem	POS	5	upgrade from charter 's modem , motorolum sb5101 to this modem . charter 30mb download 3mb upload internet package . i be get 20-22mb speed . i replace the 5101 with this modem and test several speed test site , speakeasy and charter own speed test . in the middle of the day on president day when a lot of people be home from work and probably on the internet more then a usual monday . i be get 52-60mb download and 4-4 .5 mb upload . awsome speed . well worth the upgrade .
840	CableModem	POS	5	what more can i say ? plug it in , call comcast , read they the mac address -lrb- i wish the font be bigger -rrb- and there be no drama . special note - comcast list this cable modem as approve but there be other modem on they list that seem to have go through and pass a higher level of testing . that be a concern . for i , it the ubee have be a solid little performer . incidentally - i replace a motorolum surfboard with this ubee . it turn out that the problem be a splitter in the cable . i now have the surfboard as a spare . as soon as i hear anything about ipv6 though , that surfboard be go back in because it be ipv6 compatible and this ubee be not .
42	CableModem	POS	5	i be a bit skeptical about the whole doc si 2.0 vs 3.0 thing . but i be sick and tired of my old bottlenecked network speed , and i decide to upgrade my modem , cable , and switch to gigabit configuration . at first i try to get comcast to send i this modem . after four attempt , i be tell that they would charge $ 7 a month to use it ! forget that ! buy this one and hook it up yesterday . before with the old motorola sb5101 , i be get about 2.6 mb download speed and 1.2 mb upload speed at the modem and about 1.6 mb download speed behind my 10\/100 t base standard switch . now ? while comcast say we be pay for 12-16mb , with this new modem i be clock 24-26mb at the modem and behind the new gigabit switch . this be also with cat 5e and cat 6 cable all the way around . wow ! what a difference ! this modem be take advantage of the bond pair downstream , as the download lead stay blue . if you have a large network and you be use switch , make sure to upgrade they also to gigabit configuration . behind the only remain standard switch , my bandwidth increase only come to about 6.5 mb . behind the gigabit switch , it be a steady 24-26mb . have some issue get everything set up . the modem keep power cycling and downloading , and i could not connect . i decide to let it do its thing for about 30-45 minute . finally , it stay on and connect , and i hook my laptop up direcly to the modem and i be able to access comcast 's activation page and within minute i be up and run , need nothing more than my account and phone number . we also have a gigabit vonage router . that take a little more work to connect . ultimately , after several reset and reboot , the vonage tech have i simply disconnect the coaxial cable from the modem for 30 seconds and reconnect it . not sure what that do , but it work . after that , vonage phone be up and run and network be good to go . very happy so far . update 8\/15\/2012 : after about 5 day , the vonage router start bottleneck the bandwidth and i be only get 8-10 mb behind it while still get 25mb connect directly to the sb6121 . so i buy the linksys e3200 gigabit router and use the vonage vd22 device and that take care of it , back to full speed all the way around .
846	CableModem	POS	5	have it install with comcast service , and it work flawlessly so far . i use it with a medialink router , and everything be compatible right out of the box . if i have any problem with the modem i 'll update , but so far it be perform as advertise and there be no problem with installation

385	CableModem	POS	5	i buy this to replace a motorola modem which be junk . this be a much better prodcut than the motorolum . i use it for 5 month and never experience a slow down . i recently add voip phone service from my cable company , so i be now have to use a rent modem that support voice . guess what ... the cable company modem be also arris brand and it work great .
45	CableModem	POS	5	no problem at all with this product . plug it in , call my provider and i be do . great way to save money by buy a modem instead of rent . this unit will pay for itself in under a year . i wish i have make this purchase a long time ago .
361	CableModem	POS	5	i have a antenna in the attic for my tv reception . split the signal between the tv 's in my house cut the signal strength in half . this motorola unit instead of a basic splitter bring my signal back up and allow i to divide one antenna to all of my room . do exactly what i hope .
324	CableModem	POS	5	i be skeptical that this item would not work . i have purchase a `` cheaper '' item at a big box retailer , and do nothing . however , this box work excellent . i have cable into my house . i have 2 tv 's that have digital cable box , which be always boarder line on quality signal -lrb- some channel would look scrabble sometimes , not often -rrb- . i have 3 tv 's which be hd , that do not have box -lrb- they get the 19 free hd channel -rrb- and these hd channel would scrabble or have delay ... however , install the booster and notice a immediate improvement . all my channel look brighter and 100 % perfect . in fact , on my tv 's , where i do not have the digital cable box , i pick up 2 more hd channel , now , 21 -lrb- free -rrb- , that i do not get before ! that be how weak my signal be before ; the tuner do not even find the channel . i wish there be a 6 channel . i have output 1 and 2 to my digital cable box , output 3 to another tv , and i split output 4 into 3 other tv 's . all channel work great ! \*\*\* note that you will need a piece of cable to run from the power supply to the signal booster \*\*\* do not come with .
54	CableModem	POS	5	i replace the rent cisco dpc3010 with this model . i get the same download -lrb- 40 + mbp -rrb- and upload -lrb- 4 + mbp -rrb- speed as before . the mac address change be simple , charter communications be able to facilitate it in a few minute while i be on the phone with they . the box say `` comcast certify only '' , but i can attest that it work with charter in san luis obispo county california .
625	CableModem	POS	4	i pick this up from another retailer when the motorola sb6121 give i problem the thing keep reset . a real pain when play on line game this one be fast and reliable . no problem whatsoever . a small footprint on my desk since i do not need a separate router as well . only hiccup be a standard setting that block against flood of datum attack with the high speed comcast i get 30m download so it think someone be flood my computer with datum . a email to zoom and they give i the quick answer on what security set to uncheck
244	CableModem	POS	5	the modem be run like a charm . i be glad i purchase this modem i be get a great connection speed now .
854	CableModem	POS	5	the modem arrive quickly and be just as advertise , with the exception of a miss coax cable . it take quite a while for the comcast system to establish a connection with the modem -lrb- the installer say this be typical of this modem -rrb- , but it be be work perfectly ever since connection be finally establish .
294	CableModem	POS	4	this modem work , mostly . it do not seem significantly faster than the old motorola , though i be guess it would test faster . there be a diminish return for simple web surfing when the older generation of modem be already capable of load a page in few tenth of a second . download be probably faster , but i rarely pay attention to that anyway , since i have train myself to immediately switch to another task whenever i click on a download button . i be still get request from windows 7 to connect to broadband via dial-up , so either i trigger something in win7 during the installation process , or it periodically think there be no cable modem . i just have to click the cancellation button a few time , which be annoying , but not a big deal . i have no major issue set up the modem with comcast in maryland , though it do take they a few try to get everything talk to everything else . the total time might have be 10-15 minute , vs. the 5 i have be hope for , so also no big deal .
434	CableModem	POS	5	this be very worthwhile product for anyone who have a weak cable signal or a deteriorated signal because of too much signal-splitting . turn it off and you 'll really see the difference !
410	CableModem	POS	5	charter just bump we up to 30mb and this require i get a docsis 3.0 modem and it have be wonderful !!
49	CableModem	POS	4	i buy this modem because my speed vary drastically at different time of the day , especially between 6pm to midnight when i need the internet the most , the speed would drop to less than 8 mbp . i call the isp and they say that there be something wrong with my signal strength , but they sell i a higher plan that go from 20 to 30 mbp . that do not seem to improve . the cox service guy come out and replace all the connector , say the problem of reduce strength be due to bad connector . well , that do not seem to improve . the same service guy disconnect my phone and it take another service visit two week later to fix my phone . the second service guy do not fix my internet speed either . i call the service department and the technical help say maybe i should replace my modem from the old motorola doscis 2 to doscis 3 . got nothing to lose except maybe another $ 100 to try something else . well , that seem to solve the problem . whereas before i be get 8 mbp from 6 to midnight , i be get 20 + mbps during those time . mostly i be get 30mbp . i be happy .
390	CableModem	POS	5	i order this signal booster -lrb- along with a motorola power inserter that i have to purchase from another site , btw -rrb- to resolve problem with terrible pixelation\/loss of audio and loss of channel in all but one room in we house . we signal be great at the cable 's first entry into the house , a bedroom , but since ours be split to access 6 -- that be right , 6 different room -- -lrb- i have a splitter on one of the line provide the additional connection -rrb- the signal be just waaaay too weak , especially for digital hd channel in the other room , and regular\/analog channels\/tvs be get a really fuzzy picture . this product be super easy to install - even with the power inserter -lrb- which be genius , btw , because i do not have to run a separate cable line down to my crawl space to power the unit -rrb- - and work perfectly ! regular channel be now crystal clear in all room , and digital\/hd channel be perfect ! we have have the booster for several week now and it be install under the crawl space yet we have have no issue with it at all - even with 100-deg heat outside . initially we be consider buy a more expensive splitter to see if that would resolve the problem , but this booster end up cost only slightly more than , say , a monster cable splitter ... and i feel more sure that it would definitely solve the problem . why buy a expensive splitter when you can buy a actual booster that split the cable for about the same money ? really glad i do ! i pore over a lot of review before purchase this item and my research lead i to purchase the motorola . if you be still on the fence , i definitely recommend pull the trigger - i be glad i do . also , i apologize to the seller for my delay in review , but i want to report on it after several week ' usage and hope that this review after a while of use will be helpful to other research by provide a longer-term positive perspective .

298	CableModem	POS	5	i never know that you could buy you own modem . perhaps it be just i not pay attention , but cable company charge far too much to rent a modem to you . for what it would have cost i in a year to rent a modem , i could buy the motorola surfboard and have it pay for itself in about 10 month . check with you cable company on approve modem . this one be a 3 star recommend modem from comcast and it have yet to fail i . it be fast , reliable , and easy to set up - so easy that someone without much experience with technology could set it up .

591	CableModem	POS	5	isp : comcast comcast internet package : performance -lrb- 15 mbp -rrb- comcast provide modem : they `` latest docsis 3.0 arris '' modem router : linksys e4200 v1 the reason why i buy this modem be simple ... why pay $ 7\/month to rent a modem when i can buy one myself , with potentially better spec , and cost savings 10 month out . i find good review for this modem and figure why not , especially since http:\/\/mydeviceinfo.comcast.net\/ show that this specific modem be sign off as support by comcast , along with they highest , 3-star rating . i can not be certain that the new motorola modem be buy i speed\/reliability over the arris modem , but i know that my wife and i have be run we computer and game console without a hitch . with the arris modem , we find the internet to slow down several time a week require modem reboot , but maybe we be just get lucky . but hey , possible positive be a good thing right ? i be pay for comcast 's performance package which claim speed of 15 mbp down . with the arris i be see speed around ~ 17-25 mbp down . with the new motorola i be see 20-25 mbp down -lrb- both much higher than expect -rrb- . i have see slow upload with both modem , but i think that be a comcast thing . -lrb- random : i previously have fio 25\/25 and be get 30\/25 . those be the good ol' day -rrb- if you be use this with comcast , remember that you be go to have to contact customer service and get they to send a signal to you new modem in order for it to work - do not expect it to be plug-n-play .
429	CableModem	POS	5	this be a great modem , simple to install just call you isp to activate it . no issue so far after activation , speed be good and set by you isp once they be ready to increase you internet speed you be ready for next few year until the next docsis technology come .
281	CableModem	POS	5	this dramatically improve the reception in my house . i have insight cable -lrb- ohio -rrb- and have always have several snowy channel . the cable company have be out but say there be nothing they could do , as some channel just get poor reception . to make matter worse , i recently add five new splice for a total of 10 . several tv 's have terrible reception . i choose this model so i could run the main cable input into the booster and then each output to a splitter . the main cable line enter the house into a finished office so i also like how the unit be power , too . it work absolutely fantastic . all tv 's now have excellent reception . i just can not believe that this solve my issue . it seem very well make and sturdy and it be actually pretty neat how it work . the power source be a inverter that translate the house electric to 12v . you plug it into you outlet and then run a r59 or r6 coaxial cable from the power source to the amplifier\/booster . so i just fish a new cable line in the wall near my outlet to power it , as oppose to have to deal with install a new outlet near my cable input . i have broadband internet come through my cable and have see no interference or problem with that . it be always pretty good so i be unsure if there be any improvement . to i this be well worth the money . i have several lcd tv 's around and it suck to have spend the money on they but have bad reception .
345	CableModem	POS	5	i purchase the sb6121 base on review here at amazon.com . and of course when it come to installation day with a comcast installer ... the tech could not get the modem to work . the modem would reset itself every couple of minute and he could not activate it . the installer tell i the modem be defective and to return it . he even call a person at comcast who be look at the line who say the same thing ... not work right ... return it . of course the tech go out to he comcast van and return with a older 2.0 sb5150 surfboard which install in seconds and i agree to pay the $ 7 rental monthly fee to get it up and run . i pack the modem up to reship it but come back on amazon to read the review once again and low and behold ... read numerous post by people with the same issue with comcast who have to rent a modem on the spot to get up and run . so i unpack the modem and hook it up myself follow the direction in the box . the comcast activation screen come right up and get i to the last window `` activate device '' . i leave it on there for a half hour and it would not finish so i call a live person at comcast . the nice girl have i up in run in seconds and i have have no problem since . why be it that thier tech and online rep could not activate it two day prior after mess around for a hour and a half ?? who know ... but do not give up on the modem ... its a comcast problem .

271	CableModem	POS	4	when you install this modem , if you be replace a comcast rental , ensure you have the mac -lrb- cmac or hfc mac -rrb- address handy , and call comcast first & tell they you want to provision a new modem . after several hour of try to use they webpage that come up , i have to call . also , ensure you have the correct mac address ; for example , a `` d '' can look like a zero -lrb- `` 0 '' -rrb- w\/those tiny letter , which be my only complaint on this modem so far . otherwise , the modem seem to be work great for i -lrb- though i do have to reset my wireless router and then reboot the modem to get the 2 to work together -rrb- . the modem work fine with my ooma telo box to provide voip ... if you be use comcast-provided voip\/phone or will be , this modem will not work i think ; you need a telephony modem .
809	CableModem	POS	5	the modem be a breeze to set up and have be function without fail ever since . i would recommend this to comcast cable user .

631	CableModem	POS	5	after read the review of this and other cable modem , i feel like i be take a leap of faith to purchase it because some reviewer hate it , other love it . what i find be that this be a good value for the price . it have be work solid for almost a month now , no problem . i have own a motorola surfboard sb4200 for about 10 year and it work just fine all that time , so i figure i would stick with motorola . the only reason i upgrade be that my cable provider say i need a docsis 3.0 modem . my old one still work fine on they system but be unable to provide the highest speed they offer -lrb- i think it be docsis 2.0 -rrb- . i decide not to get the more advanced model with integrate router\/switch in it because i already have a router\/switch that i have be use , plus i think a reviewer say it run hotter . anyway , this decision do not turn out perfectly , but it give i a education . more on that in a second . the best part be that when i plug directly into the modem and get on the phone with comcast , walk through the process of set it up with they , i get a immediate speed boost . on the old cable modem , i be run at about 12 mbp download , 1.5 mbp upload . now i be cruise along at 25mbp down and 4.2 mbp up . now about that router\/switch . i find out that when i plug it in to the modem , my speed drop back to 12 mbp . the reason be that the switch 's wan port only support up to 10mbp -lrb- roughly -rrb- between it and the cable modem . the router be just about as old as my previous cable modem ... so ... my next purchase be a linksys wrt54gl 4-port wireless router\/switch . the new router can talk to the modem at full speed , so i get my full 25 mbp down again . i still appreciate have the modem separate from the router because it give i more option . sometime i might want a 8-port wire router instead of be limit to 4 wire port . bottom line be that the slowdown problem be cause by the router , not by this cable modem .
495	CableModem	POS	5	buy this because i finally get tire of pay $ 5 a month to rent one from my cable company . i literally swap they , call the cable company with the mac address and be back online within five minute . i have not have any issue whatsoever . excellent product .
172	CableModem	POS	5	i purchase the motorola sb6121 because we be move and change cable company . the day that the cable installer set up the connection to the house , i have leave the modem behind at the hotel where i be stay before the mover arrive with we household goods . later that day , i hook up the modem and find it to be very easy to do . i connect it to my laptop that i have with i and it work like a charm . once the household goods arrive and i be able to set up my desktop lenovo computer , connection to the modem be again easy . i run a speed test and the modem deliver every bit of the megabyte that the cable company say we connection should produce . for price and ease of use , this be a good buy .
900	CableModem	POS	5	i buy this about a month ago because i be sick of rent one ffrom comcast for $ 7\/month or whatever they be ; plug it in and it work , no issue to date . internet do seem somewhat slow ... though i do not think that have anything to do with modem specifically .

922	CableModem	POS	5	i get tire of pay comcast to lease a old modem and decide the pay-back would be good . modem work well . take a short while of talk to support to get service work again , but it be not hard . chose this one because it be the highest rate one by comcast that be ipv6 and docsis 3.0 compatible .
210	CableModem	POS	4	took comcast about 2 hour to install , over the phone , late august 17 , 2012 . laptop gigabit controller would not properly recognize modem and would run only at 10 mb instead of 1000 . use a dell xps l511z to connect to modem . when i hook the laptop up before call comcast the lan would run at 1000 mb . comcast could not get the lan to run over 10 , so they suggest try another computer . use a older xp m140 laptop purchase 6 year ago but run windows 7 and it work at its network card 's max rate , 100 mb . restart modem and then hook it to netgear router -lrb- 100 mb wan input -rrb- and it seem to work fine with wire lan run at 100 mb , but the internet do go out unexpectedly once but start right up when i reset the router , but not the modem . the modem show it be get a internet connection , but the router show no internet connection . have comcast blast -lrb- advertise here in dc metro area at 50 down\/10 up -rrb- . got letter from comcast recommend upgrade to 3.0 modem and this modem get they 3 star test and be recommend . previous modem motorola sb5101 work fine and be 5 year old , but its download max be about 38 and sometimes just over 40 , but speed vary a lot and it be never consistent . upload be usually less than 4 . with sb6121 , speed be consistently 52 download and 10 upload . wifus download be about half the wire rate when the laptop be close to router , use netgear usb 72 mb wireless . wifus upload be 10 . it seem to be work well .
540	CableModem	POS	5	fifteen year ago + i purchase my cable modem instead of rent and be pretty happy . lately we be experience dropped\/interrupted internet service - i assume -lrb- correctly -rrb- it be the age of the modem and research available modem . this one have a pretty good rating . i purchase at what i think be a good price -lrb- store - vs - internet -rrb- i have be satisify with its operation -lrb- no more internet interruption and i be run 2 to 4 device at any one time . i be pretty lucky that i do not have to purchase a new modem sooner - hopefully this one will last a while and keep up with technological improvement . i wish there have be better instruction on set-up ... i have to go online -lrb- after set-up -rrb- to get the manual so i know what the different light be and whether they be suppose to be amber\/green\/blue \/ solid or blinking . good product and good price - i be satisfied . now if only my cable company be as easy to contact and replace .
545	CableModem	POS	5	this motorola bda-s1 be a excellent amplifier . i be use it with a digital hdtv antenna and be able to receive well over 20 channel perfectly . i would definitely purchase this product again .
395	CableModem	POS	5	i be happy i rely on amazon review and buy this cable modem to replace the lease one by comcast . in 10 month you get you money back from the lease . in my case , it have be extremely reliable , plug and play , activation be a breeze . i get the exact speed i be pay for unlike what i be get in the past with the lease gear . highly recommend .
702	CableModem	POS	5	after thoroughly go over the product review for both this modem and the sb6120 ; see the nearly equal split of trouble people be report with comcast , i call comcast before i order it . i be have trouble with my own , older docsis 2 modem -lrb- a toshiba pcx 2600 -rrb- of nearly 8 year strong -lrb- intermittent signal drop -rrb- , and figure it be time to upgrade anyway . comcast -lrb- i be in the ` burb of atlanta -rrb- come out because they be see the drop from they end , and in a surprisingly proactive effort , decide to not rule out the old modem right away . instead they work out some very minor noise issue on the line locally first , then find some more significant issue up the street and have to have a linesman tech come out . again , the one primary tech give i he cell number to stay in touch with over the course of the next two day , come back out and after they feel they have do everything and like what they be see , then they suggest replace the modem . the drop be much less than what they be , but still occur . i order this modem , it arrive as expect and call comcast to provision it . take about 15 minute on the phone and it be online . i get the same up\/down speed and ping i have with my old modem of 30d\/4u mbp . overall i be happy with the quality of the product . it be a little gray , warm plastic box with pretty bright light sit in my equipment rack . to those out there worry about the heat thing i read in the other review , this be a non-issue . mine run cooler than a freshly pour cup of coffee be feel though a ceramic mug that have not quite heat up -lrb- do that make sense ? -rrb- . in other word mine be barely warm to the touch , so i be not sure why people be knock it for that . in summary : atlanta comcast user should have no problem with this modem , just make sure comcast verify you line be clean and you should be good to go with it .
889	CableModem	POS	5	linksy cm100 cable modem with usb and ethernet connections  . now that i own my own it will save i big buck in the future . this be a great item , easily setup and work like a charm . i would suggest this ; especially if you rent one from you cable company .
451	CableModem	POS	5	i could not be happier about purchase this modem . follow in the tradition of previous motorola surfboard be rock solid workhoarse this one be no exception . i experience no resetting problem , run nice and cool but i be only run on a 20mb service . after a month of ownership i can say the review of this product be acurate and i would not hesitate to purchase another or recomend this modem to friend and family .
377	CableModem	POS	5	a return this item because rcn -lrb- my cable company -rrb- have trouble get it to work . if you want to be frugal and save that $ 5\/mo . it be worth the purchase !!
713	CableModem	POS	5	the unit have be in service for about 4 week now , and i be have no problem . seem to be a great product . easy to install and get up and run . happy with my buy .
924	CableModem	POS	5	my old motorola surfboard 8200 die after a good 10 year run and i need another one . this modem have good online review and a reasonable price at amazon . it install easily , although the instruction be a bit short and slightly vague about the signal light meaning . however it work fine and my system be up and run again . i would recommend this item for anyone who need a docsis 3 level modem .
970	CableModem	POS	5	a + + for this modem . works well with my comcast internet connection . have be use it for almost a month now . so far , so good . my internet connection speed be faster with this modem .
740	CableModem	POS	5	recently purchase this modem to replace another older motorolum gateway model . upgrade my comcast connection to 20mbp . comcast say i should be expect anywhere between 20-25 mbp but now speed test be show around 32-35mbp . i hope it stay this way . this product just rock .
811	CableModem	POS	5	i initially purchase the motorola sb6120 due to the high number of good review . about 10 % of the review do not work with comcast and i be part of that 10 % . the ubee ddm3513 modem to date have 1 bad review and be likely because of a single bad modem vs bad hardware decision like the motorola . so i give the ubee ddm3513 a try and it just work . no problem . comcast would occasionally disconnect -lrb- not the modem -rrb- and this device re-establish connection much faster than my older rent modem . i watch hulu often and the connection would re-establish before hulu would need to rebuffer . i know that the connection be lose because i be multi-tasking and search the web while watch hulu . searching would freeze and i would notice the modem light show a disconnection but hulu be still run . that be just amazing in my book
564	CableModem	POS	4	i just love this super fast modem . its be a few month now since i get it and its totally dependable and super fast . its be work day and night with no problem since i receive it ... super fast with high response .
372	CableModem	POS	5	i be able to install and setup the modem with little effort and only a short -lrb- 10min -rrb- call with comcast to set it up . i have be use it now for about 2 month and do not notice any difference , good or bad , from the modem i be rent , which i believe be a scientific america .
500	CableModem	POS	5	installation be easy and after the provider update the mac code , it work . take some time for it to sync-up . be patient . the down load and up load time do improve , however since i be use a dos2 .0 modem previously the improvement be small . hopefully this will increase as improvement to the cable system be make .
814	CableModem	POS	5	i have time warner digital cable and since move to we new place we signal have be a issue . we have two digital box and time warner refuse to boost the signal so we could hook up cable to additional tv use a coax cable . before this product try to do so kill the signal to one of the digital box . in addition , the box whose signal would get kill by other source would lose signal for high def channel from time to time with no split . i order the booster and the ohm terminator and it work like a charm . not only be we able to watch cable on all we tv with no disruption , but the picture on both digital box be crisper than before . all channel on both box work and i no longer have to constantly reboot my digital box . i be so glad i give it a try .
113	CableModem	POS	5	i want to upgrade my docsis 2.0 motorola sb5101u to a docsis 3.0 model . i wonder how many comcast customer know what internet speed they be pay for . i just spend 15 minute search within my account and i can not find any explicit mention of speed . however , my bill say i have get preferred double play and comcast 's advertising say that come with speed of `` up to 20 mbp download speed with powerboost  '' . well , even with my old sb5101u , i be consistently get 23-25 mbp download and 3.6 mbp upload on my desktop connect to the router with a ethernet cable , so it be not surprising that the new modem do not give i any improvement . still , it work fine and i 'll keep it as a hedge against any improvement that be not obvious to i at the moment or thing that comcast may have come down the pike . i do not try install the modem myself as i know comcast would have to activate it from they end . it be not trivial for the comcast agent at the other end of the phone . he keep mention something about get a ip address and not get a boot file . but , with a few retry and i unplug the modem and plug it back in to reset it , we be ultimately successful . what i take from my experience and the report of other be that the amount of agony one have to go through depend on the comcast rep who get the call , but if you persevere the installation should ultimately prove successful .
614	CableModem	POS	4	this will be the third of this modem i have buy ... now the rental fee be look better , yeesh ! to explain - i live downtown in a small town -lrb- 17k -rrb- . last year we have terrible storm and crazy flooding which kill power to half of mainstreet . not my side of town , but we still get surge and flicker . i have not realize that the first modem be not plug into a surge protector at all . lightning storm , modem die , sad face . not a problem with the modem at all - when it be not fry , it work great ! buy this modem again , use it very reliably for a year , but more storm , move and a new apartment where charter have to re-fish the cable through the wall because the old one have gash in it and be drop nearly 10 volt lower in signal than it should have be ... i think it fry the modem again . so , perhaps the modem \* could \* be a bit more resilient , but honestly , it be a piece of relatively sensitive electronics . i have to pay the price -lrb- again -rrb- for not be very careful with it . i use this couple with a  belkin wireless 150n router -lrb- f6d4230-4 -rrb-  overall i be very pleased with this router , which be why i be buy it for the third time , along with the  belkin be112230-08 12-outlet home\/office surge protector with telephone and coaxial protection  i 'll post again if there be any other update .

362	CableModem	POS	4	i purchase this modem about 2 month ago and it mysteriously stop work about a week ago . i come to find out from comcast that they do some technology upgrade to they line which make this modem not compatible with they high-speed internet service in the atlanta region . not sure if these upgrade affect other market but you will run into the same issue . despite the incompatibility with comcast now , this product be solid -lrb- as be most product that cisco\/linksys come out with -rrb- .
433	CableModem	POS	5	i have just buy this modem and it be really great and easy to use device especially with comcast . 100 % recommend !
975	CableModem	POS	5	i daytrade so i need a reliable , fast modem and this be it . have the router a few week and it be great . good reception with a strong wifus signal throughout a 2 story 2600 sqft . house . you may need to make a few tweak for you internet provider and here they be . 1 -rrb- use this if you be have slow download\/upload speed or in my case over 65 % packet loss on a ping test . you can check you dl & ul speed here -lrb- speedtest -lrb- dot -rrb- net -rrb- and test for packet loss here -lrb- pingtest -lrb- dot -rrb- net -rrb- . login to the router gateway use 192.168.0.1 and you can find you username and pass in you instruction manual . once in click firewall at the top , then web filter on the side panel . toward the bottom of the page uncheck `` ip flood detection '' and click apply . 2 -rrb- some people have report a drop wifus signal after a few day of use . this be generally cause by interference from other wireless signal in the area . to fix this login to you gateway again . this time click on wireless at the top then radio on the side panel . change you control channel # to any of the number 1-11 list then click apply . if you be still get a drop signal after the change then switch to another channel until you signal be constant . by default the control channel be set to auto which be suppose to automatically switch channel when the router detect interference but this do not always work so well . these two item tend to be the biggest issue with this router . once you get it setup right it should be clear sailing .
284	CableModem	POS	5	this be my first docsis3 wireless cable modem and have it install by the comcast serviceman . i have earlier set up the router off line for wire and wireless functionality . the direction be easy to follow for set security and the various network . i like the ability to have a private network and a guest access point . speed test show over 30 mb download and 5 mb upload , however this change from day to day . the installer have never see over 3 mb upload speed . i have no issue with strength of signal . modem be on a ground level floor and signal easily reach the second floor . other have comment on the heat this modem generate , i have the same experience , it simply run hot . there be a power adjustment that seem to allow the unit to run on 25 % , 50 % , 75 % and 100 % power setting . i will try the 75 % set to see if it run cooler without any loss in wireless signal or speed . i have a older docsis2 surfboard run on wideopenwest service for a couple of year now with no issue . much more stable than my older two unit system have a separate modem and wireless router . my it friend recommend seperate unit , but i have have a good experience with the combined modem . give the cost comparison , this one win .
412	CableModem	POS	4	i buy this cable modem to replace a dead one i originally buy several year ago from the cable company . it be easy to install and set up . the only hangup be when i call the cable company to give they the mac number so they system could communicate with it . they initially say the number i give they be not valid , but they finally accept it . they only reason i do not give it a 5-star review be that it be docsis 2 . o , not docsis 3.0 . my cable company do not support docsis 3.0 yet , but it would have be nice to have it in case they upgrade they system . i look for a cisco\/linksys 3.0 unit , as i have have good result with they equipment , but could not locate one on amazon .

509	CableModem	POS	5	the product be deliver in only 3 day . what great service . the cable modem be easy to install , one call to comcast and the modem be up and run . be work great since the day i install it .
684	CableModem	POS	5	i have the highest speed comcast connection available in my area and have be pay a monthly modem fee for several year now . i have be think about purchase my own modem for some time but just hadnt get around to it . with the lease modem i be get around 9-15 mbp on speakeasy or other speedtest site . with the motorola sb6121 i be now average 30 + mbps and have even see it peak up to 80mbp at time ! this modem will pay for itself in a year and be a amazing improvment over the lease comcast modem . setup be a breeze and i have have no issue with it . i just wish i would have upgrade a few year ago .
782	CableModem	POS	5	cable modem be not something for you to take care of in daily life . a good modem should be install and forget . it be the reason why i do not upgrade my modem from docsis-1 to docsis-2 until 2009 . i do not do it until i realize my internet speed be much slower than what comcast promise then . that upgrade raise the average download throughput from 5 to 15mbp . i have be use the same internet service for more than one decade . the cable company promise 1.5 mbp at very begin . with the same monthly rate they push up they promise speed gradually . the speed be raise to 20mbp recently . but you can not enjoy the speed boost if you keep use you old hardware . my 3-year old motorola sb5101 be also a good install and forget modem . but the connection speed can become very slow in evening , the rush hour of residential internet . docsis-3 provide the channel bonding feature which be better in retain bandwidth even in rush hour . you must contact the cable company to activate you new cable modem before use it . it be not a big deal for i because i do it twice in past decade , but i can not recall all the detail . the first comcast specialist try to activate my sb6121 many time w\/o luck so that he transfer my call to a 2nd tier specialist . he ask i to power-cycle my modem -lrb- shut down then turn on again -rrb- , then it work flawlessly . yes , power-cycle be a necessary step in activation . the first specialist forget it and waste i almost one hour . my download speed be quite stable -lrb- 16 ~ 21mbp -rrb- now , even in evening . the throughput be only slightly faster but much more consistent than before . it work as promise . internet technology keep evolve so that you can not always install and forget it . update -- i replace my old linksys router with e3200 one month later . now the download speed be always fix at 25mbp , 24\/7 . look like 25mbp be the speed cap set by comcast . the sb6121 + e3200 combo should be able to run even faster if i be willing to pay higher monthly rate . once again you need up-to-date gear in order to get full bandwidth from the internet connection you pay for .
670	CableModem	POS	5	i too be hit by a monthly modem rental fee all of a sudden by comcast , so rather than pay they more , i order this modem to replace a lower model surfboard . it arrive very quickly , as usual . i disconnect the old one , connect this one , call comcast and literally 3 minute later i be up and run again . it be work perfectly since . another reviewer note that it run hot , and that be true , but do not seem to be a problem .
487	CableModem	POS	5	when my old cable modem suddenly start reset itself , i replace it with this one . it work like a champ with speed much higher than that of old one . the setup take just 5 min . i be tell by comcast tech support that for `` performance '' internet service this be the ideal modem as it support docsis 3.0 .
192	CableModem	POS	5	i have be use my own motorola sb4200 with comcast for quite a while . so long , that comcast inform i that the unit be now `` end of support '' , and that i might be get less throughput than i be pay for , due to the old hardware . purchase the sb6121 , and spend a couple of minute on the phone with comcast support to get the new modem activate . speed test on the old sb4200 just before i unplug it : 12mb down \/ 2mb up . speed test on the new sb6121 -lrb- same website , minute apart -rrb- : 24.5 mb down \/ 3.6 mb up . i be so stunned by the improvement that i ask comcast support to confirm that they have provision it for the proper rate on my account . the answer come back `` affirmative . '' the novelty of rapid download have not wear off yet - android update to my touchpad report `` 19 % , 65 % , do ! '' , and that be over wi-fus ! as the title indicate , color i thrill !
263	CableModem	POS	5	absolutely amazing difference in analog picture quality ! i use a two way splitter to run a line straight to my cable modem as recommend and attach the other cable to the motorola booster . from the booster i use three of the four hookup for signal to three tv , one of which i split again with a good two way splitter so that i could drop a line to my computer tv card . before i have horizontal line on many of the channel and a couple be almost unviewable . the line be all go now and the picture on all three analog tv and the computer be terrific ! a unintended side effect be that my cable modem throughput have also increase because it be now be route straight to the computer from the original two way splitter . i wish that i have do this year ago ! if you have analog tv with fuzzy or striped picture i highly recommend this booster !
569	CableModem	POS	5	we have comcast cable and decide to discontinue rent they modem , which be a 2.0 - save $ 7 a month ... new modem will pay for itself , right ? i order the modem , amazon deliver it the next day ... i love be a prime member . we connection be operate at 12 mbp and jump to 25 mbp . we be a family that run netflix on the tv , tivo , a kindle , dsi , and up to 3 wireless laptop at a time !
690	CableModem	POS	5	only have this modem for a week , but it have be rock steady so far . only problem i have with installation be i misread a d as a 0 in the mac address because of they tiny size . once i catch that error , it go smoothly . i dont know why they make the digit so small ! -lrb- and yes i do have my glass on , but you need a magnifer glass ! -rrb- have read several report of this unit run hot , but i dont find that to be true . at least it run cooler than the cable company supply aires modem . very happy so far .
905	CableModem	POS	5	this cable modem work great with my comcast internet . comcast service technician complete the setup so i can not vouch for ease of setup , but unit have work flawlessy for several month . i have not need to reset the modem even once .
743	CableModem	POS	4	use this modem with comcast . i do not even have to call they to activate it . i just use the self-activation website and be up and run in less than 5 minute . i get this to replace a sb6121 because i want 8 downstream channel , plus the sb6121 run too hot and i have to have a fan blow on it . i be on the blast 25\/4 tier and with the sb6121 i be get 36.5 mbp down and 6.5 mbp up with power boost . with the dpc3008 i be get 36.1 down and 5.6 up with power boost . kind of disappointing . like with the dpc3000 and dpc3010 , the dpc3008 's diagnostic screen be gimp to only show you the signal level . no channel frequency , no uptime , and no log . if motorola can show all this information in a read-only format , why can not cisco ? another disappointment . as long as the modem work it be not that big of a deal , but detailed diagnostic information can be very helpful if you really need it . temperature wise the dpc3008 run cooler than the sb6121 and do not need a fan blow on it , so i 'll stick with it for now .
109	CableModem	POS	4	arrive in a timely manner with all the necessary cable as advertise . clear instruction and a breeze to set up .
227	CableModem	POS	5	the three word describe my review : small , easy , reliable pretty much sum up this product . this be the second one i be buying -lrb- the first be for my dad 's house -rrb- and now one for my home . its responsive , solid , and back by the market 's lead network manufacturer . not to mention its one of the only modem out there that have the service to back up the price . plus - who want to pay a rental fee with they isp ? lame right ? get the cisco cm100 couple with the cisco linksys router -lrb- form g w \/ linux os -rrb- and you be look at a flawless system set up to run 2 + year without hiccup .
779	CableModem	POS	5	i can not tell you how many time i call my local cable tv provider -lrb- comcast -rrb- to complain about the poor picture quality on my tv . i be unable to watch my brand new sony flat screen hd tv due to pixelization and completely blank channel . it be happen every day . all comcast would do be send a signal to the digital box to try to correct it . they even send a service man out to look at it . he check all the connection inside and out and tell i if the problem continue , to call . they be totally worthless . i be ready to cancel my cable tv subscription , when someone at work suggest a signal booster . so , i sign onto my favorite website in the world ! ... amazon.com ... and find this wonderful little thing ! very simple to hook up outside where the cable wire feed into the house . it be like flip a switch . no more pixel across my screen and i be also able to pick up channel i do not have before ! it really do work . i have have it now for 2 week and have not have one problem with my tv . well worth the $ 52 i pay for it !  motorola signal booster 4-port bda-s4 cable modem tv hdtv amplifier
436	CableModem	POS	5	the zoom5350 be a excellent product and be easy to set up . the only adjustment i have to make be at the zoom website in the configuration manager -lrb- i simply unchecked one of the box as be suggest -rrb- . this change improve both download & upload speed . i replace a older docsis 2.0 modem that work fine , but have slower download speed in the 5-8 mbp range . this zoom be docsis 3.0 which allow i to receive the full 30 mbp that my cable provider supplies . i be a average computer user that prefer to web browse without wait .
442	CableModem	POS	5	comcast user in ca . run a cable modem and a hd box off 1 co-ax in -lrb- set-up be cable in - to junction box - to cable modem out and cable box from tap -rrb- . i be have issue with several hd channel and i want to add another line so i could have 2 cable feed on my 60 '' screen -lrb- as in watch 2 football game -- yup -rrb- . i get this box -lrb- install before the junction box -rrb- along with the audiovox dh24spr two way 2.4 ghz bi-di splitter -lrb- install on the co-ax from the tap - then to cable box + tv in -rrb- . result -- endzone ! the mess up channel be back on my hd box , my internet be just as crazy fast as it be before -lrb- maybe - maybe faster -rrb- , and i now can watch two channel at once on my tv with split screen . i be a techie guy and research everything well before buy , and this one be a hit . i recommend .
958	CableModem	POS	5	i have not update my modem in quite a while , probably two year . these new docsis 3.0 modem really make a difference . i have see a significant increase in internet speed . look nice and solid too .
473	CableModem	POS	5	i use this unit for about a month with comcast cable . this unit replace the rental from comcast -lrb- i get tire of pay they $ 7 every month -rrb- . call the company , give they the mac address and in 5 minute i be back online . so far it seem to work just fine . moderate improvement on the speed and reliability ; satisfy with the purchase .
963	CableModem	POS	5	i recently switch from dsl to high speed internet , basically from centurylink to charter . while talk with the charter rep , i manage to find the listing of all the modem that they lease out and come across this beauty . i decline to lease this modem from they , as they want $ 7 a month , so you basically buy two of these modem over the course of a two year contract . so this be a no-brainer and i buy it . the technician that come out be surprise to see this modem while hook everything up as the docsis 2.0 modem can not handle very high speed , and this be where the docsis 3.0 come in . i be download speed up to 50 mbp now . i just have to change my wireless router setting to dhcp and the docsis 3.0 take over and i be on my way to the high speed superhighway ! i do not have to go into the modem gui to mess with any setting either . so basically i hook this up from the coax cable in the wall , feed a cat6 cable from it to my wireless dual band router , set my router to dhcp , and everything on my network instantly have connection . its worth the money if you be look to get speed of over 30mbp to you home and lease one from the cable company be just a waste of money in my opinion .
660	CableModem	POS	5	have some initial setup issue , but it turn out it be comcast . this modem run like a champ . i be get 50 + mbp download -lrb- what i pay for -rrb- and setup be simple . it be also aesthetically please . . the modem be small and can be inconspicuous of place properly .

13	CableModem	POS	5	it seem faster but not consistently . upload seem to rate faster than before . i have reach speed that i do not have before on the free internet speed test website -lrb- try the usual trio -rrb- . i have comcast . this model be accept by they . they do not support all model . you need to call they to make it work and give they the sn and some other number on the box -lrb- the sn be on the unit , but not the other number so you really need to keep the box when you call they -rrb- . after the call , it work fine . make sure you phone be not voip or else you 'll need to call they first i assume . so it be faster , but not a huge different on a daily basis , except if you have dropbox or thing like that that can take a lot of time to upload -lrb- the file ... especially if it be gb -rrb- .
275	CableModem	POS	5	i buy this device to use with comcast cable internet service . it work fine right out of the box . if you have comcast and need a docsis 3.0 modem , this device be for you .
965	CableModem	POS	5	just work like the rental cisco cable modem i get from comcast . no issue of connection drop\/reset as describe by other people in review . till now i feel definitely worth get and escape the expensive rental cost
43	CableModem	POS	5	we be a comcast customer and we spend quite a friggin lot for hdtv and other upgrade . but we be experience annoying problem : during we favorite show , it would periodically pixellate , stutter , or even freeze for several seconds . we would end up have to watch on regular non-hd channel -lrb- when possible -rrb- . on-demand movie download be impossible , they would always crash or do the same thing . and dvr would show would do it , and on some occassion the dvr recording seem to black out -lrb- but we figure out way to get they to `` pop back '' , by start other recording and then switch half-way -rrb- . we have comcast out several time . they upgrade we cable , assure we it be near 100 % signal into the house , and even check the signal to the tv 's . they even install a amplifier . i swap theirs out and put this one in its place . wow . we signal even look better and all those issue go away ! one caveat : i notice the comcast guy use a amplifier and then split off into 3 cable after the single amplify line ! idiot !!! i 'll bet if it be a 4-way splitter we would have never have these issue . in any event , this fix the problem . if you be experience similar issue , get this booster . it work great ! finally we be get what we pay all this money for !!!
195	CableModem	POS	5	excellent product at a great value . delivery be quick . setup be easy . work great so far . also purchase in conjunction with belkin router and they be a great combo .

184	CableModem	POS	5	comcast in the san francisco area be my cable and internet provider . i have rent they modem at $ 3 a month for many year . they do i a favor when it be announce that they would be increase they modem rental to $ 5 a month ! i buy the linksys cm 100 cable modem , make by cisco , after read a review of how good it work with comcast , with faster speed than when use the comcast modem . installation be easy , but , remember to unplug you router if you have one , and plug the modem directly into you computer for installation . it would have be nice if the installation direction and cd which come with the modem make that very clear , because , even though i show connectivity , when i call comcast to give they the mac number and get my new modem register with they , i could not get a browser to open up . comcast have always be very helpful if i have ever have a connectivity problem , and that be the first question they ask : do i have a router ? once i disconnect the router and reinstall the modem with the cd , which take 2 minute , comcast get i online and my browser come up right away , and i reconnect my router with no problem since . in less than a year at $ 5 a month my modem will have pay for itself with the one time cost . i be very happy with it , and thank comcast for save i money in this regard !

514	CableModem	POS	5	works like it be suppose to . i like the design compare to the older model . speedtest be show the corresponding result to what i be sign up for with comcast . there be a review here that state you need to give you customer id print on the box label instead of the mac address to comcast in order to get this add and work . i be not sure how accurate that be . i have a issue get the modem online in my new apartment but that be because of a cable wiring issue , not because mac address\/customer id number . i have mention this to two different comcast tech and both tell i that the customer id have nothing to do with it -lrb- before get a tech out to my home and confirm it be a wiring issue -rrb- . i be up and run now and it be be run great . i buy this because i hate give more money away to comcast or any provider for that matter . leasing fee on equipment for both internet provider or digital tv be ridiculous when they be already make money off you service .
903	CableModem	POS	5	receive the unit fast and come in great condition . no issue and be easy to setup . keep in mind you will need to call comcast after connect the unit and give they the mac address to connect it on they side .
788	CableModem	POS	4	easy to set up and immediately fix the problem we be have with a weak signal from comcast . the comcast box and dvr be barely receive a signal cause pixilation and in many case a error code , especially if someone be simultaneously use a computer . we set up be three cable box and one cable modem .
590	CableModem	POS	5	make the jump to light speed with this modem and what a difference . have a problem get up and run and i think that be because the comcast software only give you the choice of they modem to install with . have to call they twice . second time it be a snap to get go . use netflix with my at&t; dsl take forever to load . clarity be not great either . with my cable dsl through this modem it movie start almost immediately and the clarity be hd quality . best yet , i be not spend $ 5 per month to lease they cable modem ! if i have to do all over again i would get up and run use the cable company modem then switch the next day .
961	CableModem	POS	5	works really well , i be not sure if it be i or how this be possible but my downstream speed have jump up by 10 mbp on average i go from a avg of 7-10 to 19-25 mbp . i connect the old modem just to test it out . nice and compact i love it , i sit it broadside down not like in picture .
995	CableModem	POS	4	the less i pay comcast , the better . this should pay for itself in a few month . make sure you have you comcast account number before you install , you will need it to reconnect to they network .
956	CableModem	POS	4	this cable modem may not be the fastest available but in the short tome i have be use it , it have be totally dependable for my high speed internet . that be the reason why i switch from dsl to cable . my qwest dsl be never dependable .
754	CableModem	POS	4	i have have this install on comcast -lrb- north nj -rrb- for the last week . so far it be work fantastic , operate well above what i would have expect to get off comcast 's network . that be say it do appear to be somewhat sensitive to signal issue . i have to have a comcast tech come out and help trace out a wire because the modem would go squirrely around 9:30 or 10 every night and then start work in the morning . we located and remove 2 splitter which have clean up the signal strength issue -lrb- it be run at the top of the spec would strength for outgoing and incoming message -rrb- . hopefully thing continue go well !
444	CableModem	POS	5	got this with charter internet installation to replace verizon dsl service . as a aside , the dsl be molasses compare to cable . anyhow , as for this modem , we have have zero issue . no dropout , no random reboot , etc. . however , it make no sense pay a monthly fee for a $ 86 item , so now that the rental unit have prove itself , we 'll be buy the same model to replace it . for what it be worth , my bet be that 90 % of complaint about modem a router not work correctly have more to do with user not set they up correctly than with the product themselves .
914	CableModem	POS	5	modem work great with comcast . i upgrade from a fail sb5100 . connection be very stable with 25 mbp download\/4mbps upload speed . it be very easy to setup without a call to comcast . it take about 10 minute to complete the configuration of the new modem . here be what i do : 1 -rrb- power down computer , modem and router , if you use one . 2 -rrb- disconnect cable that go to old modem . 3 -rrb- connect internet cable to new modem . 4 -rrb- connect a ethernet cable from modem to computer . there be one supply with modem . 5 -rrb- power on new modem and wait for all four light to stop flash , this might take a while . 6 -rrb- start computer and open up you internet browser . the browser will go to the xfinity configuration page automatically . 7 -rrb- if you be already a xfinity customer hit the blue login link . if you be a new customer fill in you account number and phone number . 8 -rrb- follow the online instruction to complete the new modem activation . 9 -rrb- once you establish a internet connection you be do . if you be use a wireless router continue with this : 1 -rrb- power off the computer and modem . 2 -rrb- disconnect ethernet cable from modem to computer . 3 -rrb- plug in the ethernet cable from modem to router . 4 -rrb- power on modem and wait for all the light to stop flash . 5 -rrb- power on router . 6 -rrb- power on you computer and you be do .
355	CableModem	POS	4	\* i be not sure if my performance issue be due to comcast or the modem . \* the performance be great , but there be occasion where my speed will seriously slump down to 1 mbp down , but 4 mbp up . but if there be such a thing as a good look modem , this be it .
842	CableModem	POS	4	i be look to save on some month to month modem rental fee from the cable company and after read the review , decide on this model . i use comcast and be a little concerned about what i have read when it come to set up this modem with this provider . it be good that i be prepare for some hiccup because you probabaly will run into some . stay patient ! i start by plug the coaxial cable into the modem , then the power cord , then ethernet into the modem and finally into the computer . click on ie and the comcast set up page initiate . so far so good . i input my #s , hit submit and here 's where the aggrevation begin . it seem like it be progress and then the connection seem to freeze and the modem power down . i attempt to repeat again and again but i do not seem to make any progress until i would completely unplug the modem and basically start from scratch . i then would get to the next comcast setup screen but would have to power down again , and again . eventually , you will make it through it and once you do , you will have some pretty fast internet . i be speed along at 25 mbp . i want to stress here that i feel that the setup hangup be definitely more comcast related as other 's have claim . the biggest and only negative so far be the fact that this modem only have one ethernet outlet which can hinder the set up of a home wifus . you may need tech support for you router . i couple mine with a belkin n150 and after have a 15 minute conversation with the tech -lrb- would have be 10 min . if i could understand she english ! -rrb- , have my household internet rolling . as i mention , be patient and you will be more than happy with this modem . well worth the money .

150	CableModem	POS	4	this router have a lot of capability and install easily , either manually or by wps . i have no issue with it in my mother 's apartment , a simple configuration with a pc , router and printer . the router be feed by comcast . later , it become apparent that the throughput on wireless be somewhere between sluggish and abysmal . at first i think it be comcast , then the pc . after try out multiple change include the computer , i be able to inch the speed up to nearly a usable level - - still pretty sad , maybe 1-2 megabyte per minute . just as a matter of thoroughness , i change the printer from wireless to usb . wow ! what a difference . wireless speed pick up by at least a factor of 10 . megabyte in seconds not minute . as of right now , i do not know if this be a router , configuration , or printer issue . it be not important to have the printer on wireless , so this riddle be go to remain unanswered for a while . i 'll leave the rating at 4 star instead of 5 because of the router `` ip flooding '' set be one of the issue . this setting default to yes , and if set to no , the speed pick up significantly , perhaps 2:1 or more . this setting be access under the firewall tab in the management page .

315	CableModem	POS	5	comcast give i a motorola 5120 the bandwidth be fluctuate horribly on speedtest.net also the modem max out at 30mbps mega bit per second mbp be mega byte per second the difference be weather the b be lower case or b upper case . a byte be consider 8-bit . in some system there be error correction and other overhead route information of up to they say 15 % of you bandwidth . not to much testing and i have hit a high of 38 mbp download the bandwidth be nonfluctuating\/stable . the same of ~ 6mbp for upload . the follow be help with self install and self activation on comcast you mileage may vary on cable company . extra paragraph\/note not on modem : after all of this be do if you want a suggestion on block different type of web site -lrb- 30 million people use it . -rrb- use free opendns.com simple or complex , 40 different category and certain add and spoof its free unless you want long term tracking of site successfully block or where the kid have try to access . corporate be not free . this next step be to set up so you can `` self activate '' on comcast when you have switch , hub , router , wireless . pull the power cord on you modem and with preferably the same cable connect directly to a power off computer or laptop and then plug back the power back in you modem . make sure the cable modem have initialize itself then turn on the computer test and make sure a refresh web page come up -lrb- in case you do not shut down you computer -rrb- . the next step be that you be go to give back you old cat-5 cable and test you new pre-test cat-6 cable . unplug modem , shut down computer . now plug in you new cat-6 cable which on mine be pre-test , and plug it in to the modem and computer . plug the power back in to the modem after the modem initialize turn on the computer verify that the cable work and you pull up a refreshed page not a current page -lrb- in case you do not shut down you computer . -rrb- if if say that there be `` no connection available '' , sometimes you have to see-see the connection back and forth which i have to do at the laptop connector . finally if you want do you last speedtest.com look for , first , the unevenness of the graph the peak and valley what you want be a nice stable plato  , second be write down the peak download speed in mbps and third the upload speed peak in mbps . now to swap the modem . first you want the modem to run when the cable company test it so pull the power first . then the pre-test cat-6 cable . now the cable tv rj-59u or rj-58u you might need pliers to start to loosen the connection but the rest should be hold with finger and spin . now the semus tough part that center wire of the cable will not want to go into that new gold plate connector so make sure the wire be in the center , its align , and push , that be the hard part -- finish screw in , plug in the pre-test cat-6 cable to the modem and this time i would really recommend shut down the computer because even i do because it go to take ~ 5 minute for the modem to initialize . mental note : i notice the box vent on one side and a very little from the front so i put the side with all the vent up . but i have air cleaner to clean it or you could get a hepa filter . temp be nominal but i have it on a cement floor . now turn on you computer . go to start , all programs , accessories , command prompt . type : ipconfig\/release type : ipconfig\/renew now open internet explorer in the address bar type activate.comcast.com \/ you will need you account number and account telephone . next call 1-800-xfinity 934-6489 go to tech support tell they you get you own modem , you install it and self activate it . and you need to give they you mac address its a motorola surf board sb6121 i be in a sandstone building and go outside and use the cell phone do not take to long then they send i in to test and see if a web page would come up and it do and my cell connection hold and i say thanks to eternity the representative and that be all . this new modem have hit 8mbp higher at the highest and the bandwidth have a nice nonfluctuating platoe  . in google chrome i can re-open a dozen of closed web page and the load time seem reduce the reason i do not say for sure be that my 4 thread processor be not run at its normal burried 100 % so the program might not be fight for cpu time . bruce light color be amber for on , blue upload , blue download , amber connect to computer , flash blue for the fastest connection .
441	CableModem	POS	5	this item be recommend to i by a friend who be very satisfied with it-so i buy it and be happy also-do recommend this item . it arrive in perfect shape and be on deliver on time and quickly
911	CableModem	POS	5	i have internet service thru charter , and purchase this modem to replace the charter rental unit . it be easy to install , and come with everything i need .
33	CableModem	POS	5	i have comcast xfinity performance , rate at 20 mb\/sec down , and 4mb\/sec up . this modem replace a lease rca dcm315r . speed test with the dcm315r be 15\/4 . the 6121 perform better with download speed of 25 mb\/sec , upload do not change .
650	CableModem	POS	5	i be worry when shop for a cable modem that i would not find one compatible with xfinity , this be the same brand they use and it work perfectly once they initialize it . no problem so far and i do not think there will be any since xfinity would not want to purchase a inferior product themselves .
221	CableModem	POS	5	we just buy this as a upgrade from a older motorola modem , and we love it . we play online game and the old modem would boot we offline frequently and would reset randomly periodically during the day . after figure out that maybe we modem just could not handle it - i do some research , find this to be comcast approve , call comcast for setup , and it work like a charm -lrb- so far -rrb- . speed be noticeably faster and the connection be far more stable . would definitely recommend . setup be easy - but i do recommend call you cable provider so they can send a signal to the modem and get it set up . the only thing i find annoying about this modem be that the datum link constantly flash make i think the modem be offline - but this be normal for this model . i be very happy with it .
269	CableModem	POS	5	i decide to switch to comcast xfinity internet in my area as they offer the fastest speed available , faster than what i be get with at&t; uverse . as i look into extra fee , i notice comcast would charge $ 7\/month for rent they modem . i figure i will have they as my isp for at least a year , so i do not hesitate in skip they modem rental and buy my own . amazon ship and deliver the modem fast . once i get it , i simply plug a coax cable from the splitter in my closet to the modem . i then plug in a rj45 cable from the modem to my router . i power it on , call comcast to activate my service -lrb- basically give they the mac address of the modem -rrb- , and i be online within 20 minute of open the box the modem come in . very simple to install , and no problem whatsoever so far .
839	CableModem	POS	5	own you own modem be the smart way to go . comcast be charge we $ 5 a month to rent one , it take just 8 month to save money with this modem . -lrb- this modem be on sale when i buy it -rrb- this be the most reliable cable modem i have ever use . i have have it for about two year now and it be still go strong . i can not think of the last time i have a network problem that be the fault of the modem . i do not even reset the modem anymore when have problem , since it be always the router . pretty amazing for a refurbish modem . it be a shame linksys brand router be not this dependable . if they be i would be a very happy camper . one downside : this modem use the aging docsis 2 standard , which do not support ipv6 . when isp start to roll out ipv6 you will not be able to take advantage of it with the cm100 . it do not matter at all for normal people because ipv6 support will not be \* require \* for many , many year , but if you be a techie like i and you want ipv6 asap , you be better off get a modem that support it .
772	CableModem	POS	5	this modem solve my problem . the issue be i be loose connection on my surfboard i have have for year . have my cable company check the street , and i run some neutralize test to issolate the problem to my surfboard , get this thing , and all be well . the lesson here ? buy a modem be cheaper than rent , duh ! , but have a modem for 4-5 year you have to remember that technology have a shelf life , and i reach mine a month ago with that surfboard .
818	CableModem	POS	5	i update my motorola modem from docsis 2.0 to a motorola docsis 3.0 . i have do some research on different brand and docsis 2 vs 3 , and be please with the product . i have a very noticeable improvement immediately in download speed via cox cable . the modem be easy to install and get update the log into the cox record -lrb- by call cox -rrb- . it get slightly warm , but probably less than my old one - as it have better ventilation hole . it be deliver in just a few day - faster than expect .
47	CableModem	POS	4	i purchase this modulator-demodulator -lrb- modem -rrb- for use with my comcast broadband internet service . it be work well with no complaint , no complaint at all !
169	CableModem	POS	4	the motorola sb6121 modem seem to be speed up my connection to the internet . i have only have it run for a few day but i immediately see a difference as soon as i connect it . hope it continue to perform this well for a long time to come .
661	CableModem	POS	5	i have a single cable enter my home , that comcast install . for at least a year i be able to use a cheap passive 2-way splitter and watch both my tv thru a tivo premiere , and access the internet at 25mbp -lrb- nice -rrb- . but recently , for a unknown reason , the internet signal become too weak to access the web . the tivo continue to work , as apparently it do not require as strong a signal . if i remove the splitter , and connect the cable directly to my cable modem , the internet would work . but i want to watch tv , too ! every call to comcast end with they want to send a technician over - while charge i $ 50 for the house call . although i have have skilled and professional comcast techs over in the past , i have find the majority do nothing but turn my cable modem on and off , and usually leave with no solution . so i proceed to eliminate the obvious . i inspect the cable outside my home . it look in excellent shape , physically . indoors , i swap splitter . i swap cables . no improvement . but by search the internet , i finally learn something new : i could check the signal strength myself , with equipment i already own ! my tivo premiere , and probably every dvr , have a sub-menu that will display signal strength . i discover mine be 67 . on a scale up to 100 , 67 be not good . and my zoom 5341 cable modem -lrb- very recent and docsis 3.0 -rrb- have a signal strength display as well . i expect pretty much any cable modem will have this function . just open m explorer , type in 192.168.100.1 as a address , and you 'll be take to the access page . log in , and on a sub-menu the signal strength will be display . mine be in the -5.5 to -6.5 range , on all channel . awful . so i purchase and install the bda-s4 . the signal strength on tivo leap from 67 to 89 ! nice . but the cable modem be report no signal at all - zero . i call comcast again , and arm with this knowledge , emphasize how bad my signal strength be , for both device . the tech on the phone be impressed i could read the signal . for the first time i feel in control . he try to fix it , run i through the usual turn-it-on turn-it-off reboot drill , to no effect . each time i check the signal and tell he how poor the signal be . at last he say he need to talk to another tech - and simply disappear . he do not hang up on i , but must have be go for 30 minute or more . i never speak to he again . but what do happen , be quite suddenly the internet work ! my signal have increase from -6.0 to +6.0 . very nice . clearly comcast do something , at they home office , that correct my signal . no tech need to visit at all . i be still use my bda-s4 , though ultimately i probably do not need it . it look to be very well make , and effective . bottom line : before you purchase any amplifier , check the signal strength yourself . you dvr and you cable modem should have this function already , you just need to know where to look . good luck !
513	CableModem	POS	5	device do exactly what it be suppose to do . when the motoroloa docsis 3.0 modem i acquire would not function on my cable provider 's network i decide to give the ubee a try . it perform flawlessy , wish i could say the same for the cable company .
697	CableModem	POS	5	order myself the motorola sb6121 to replace my sb5101 . my older modem would continuously drop and loose signal w\/cox . i have have my new sb6121 set up for two day now and have not drop once ! netflix and hulu run like a dream . very happy to have spend the extra moolaa !! well worth it !
940	CableModem	POS	4	no problem for 2 month now . cheaply build , but work well . it arrive on time and work with comcast internet provider .
96	CableModem	POS	5	the modem be not even bad at all . i use to have a docsis 2.0 modem and it suck . it keep on drop its connection to comcast . i buy this modem and it work perfectly . i dont know what other people be talk about , because this modem work just fine to i .
554	CableModem	POS	5	i buy this as a upgrade for my old motorola docsis 2.0 modem since cox recommend docsis 3.0 for the preferred cable internet package i be on . i be hope for a small boost in speed but i have find that i have get up to a 50 % boost in both upload and download speed ! it seem that cox use bond channel for preferred and i simply be not take advantage of that since docsis 2.0 do not support bond channel usage . overall , if you currently have a docsis 2.0 modem , i recommend you check with you cable internet provider to see if a docsis 3.0 modem be recommend . you might be miss out !
886	CableModem	NEG	1	i purchase this modem because it seem to be well-reviewed and compatible with comcast . it seem like a preferable alternative to pay $ 7\/month to rent a modem from comcast . unfortunately , it do not work . upon reboot , it would take 10-15 minute to establish a link with comcast . my comcast subscription include 15mbp service , but this modem be only allow download at about 80kbp , if it be work at all . i purchase a sb6120 , and it connect in 1 minute and be average 16-18mbp for download . from what i understand from read around about this modem , the sb6121 be far less tolerant of signal issue -lrb- noise , weak signal -rrb- than older one . maybe the wiring in my apartment be not ideal . either way , the sb6121 do not work for i .
938	CableModem	NEG	1	have comcast come out to install internet and could not get this modem to recognize the signal . return and will buy a different model . weird that this be a recommend model by comcast if so many people have issue with it . oh well .
415	CableModem	NEG	1	after read review i purchase this modem think it would be just what i be look for . i be in need of a modem so i pay for next day delivery -lrb- friday morning -rrb- . package arrive early saturday morning , and be happy that it arrive so early . open up the box , and go about get it set up . plug in the power , and nothing ! the modem will not power on ! try every outlet in this house . nothing . very , very upset and disappointed . seller only offer a refund , will not send a new one for you to have . guess i be head to best buy after my refund clear .
658	CableModem	NEG	1	i receive this modem promptly , but when i plug it in , it be dead . no light go on . when i get in touch with the seller , i be tell i would have to send it back and pay for ship both way . i be also tell that i would have to pay a 20 % restock fee , but when i object to this outrage , i be tell that digital media source `` could waive '' the restock fee . furthermore , when i call motorola technical support and give they the serial number , i be tell that the warranty on this modem have expire . this mean that the advertising be fraudulent , since the modem be advertise as new . i would not buy this modem if i be you , because if you do , you could end up with a modem which have no more functionality than a rock and for which you would have to pay shipping both way . the tracking number show that the seller receive my package on august 20 , but it be now september 1 and i have receive no refund at all . i do not yet know if i will ever get a refund even for the purchase price without the shipping . beware !
897	CableModem	NEG	2	i have grow to be a fan of linksys \/ cisco product s for a while . i keep get call from comcast state that my current purchase cable modem be no longer support , and they would be happy to send i a new one free of charge , but of course , add the $ 7 per month rental charge . i work out of my home and have notice my voip call , and download be not as fast as they should have be after i analyze my current system . i go ahead and purchase this product due to it be a cisco product , and it be certify by comcast . after receive the product , i run with the modem for almost a month and speed down and up be fantastic . my voip call be clearer , and streaming and video call be much smoother . however , i notice that the modem would randomly drop the signal , and re-synch up again . the modem be in a open area , so i new it be not a heat issue , nor do the unit ever become hot . i call cisco support , who direct i to comcast support , as they claim it be a firmware issue that comcast would manage . i check online , and in the comcast forum , i find other who also have the same issue . the current firmware release from january 2012 be the issue , and the only solution be for comcast to roll-back the firmware to a august 2011 release . after almost 10 contact -lrb- phone or chat support -rrb- with comcast to report the issue and direct they to they own forum , the firmware be never roll back , and the issue do not go away . i have to inevitably send the product back to and replace with a surfboard sb6121 . it be a alright modem so far , but upload speed not so good as upload be only bond to one channel . i 'll report back if something go wrong with this new modem .
24	CableModem	NEG	1	it die the second month after purchase . possibly due to a\/c adapter failure . i be go to walmart right now for a new a\/c adapter . it be inconvenient for the user , time waste and frustrate . cable modem be the last motorola product i trust besides mobile radio . i hope this be just bad luck !
259	CableModem	NEG	1	this modem drop connection and\/or get hang up constantly . it get hang up and reboot itself several time a day . sometimes i have to manually reset\/power cycle the modem to get it back up and run again . you should not have to manually reset or power cycle you modem 2-10 time a day , especially a brand new modem . try troubleshoot with comcast and be refer to linksys tech support , who then try to refer i back to comcast . after tell they that comcast refer i to linksys in the first place , they tell i it be beyond they scope of expertise and refer i to cisco tech support . cisco tech flat out say that they could not do anything for i or my problem since there be nothing configurable on the modem . i ask if the modem be faulty then would not cisco have to replace it under they 1 year warranty ? the cisco tech say there be nothing they can do to help . this problem with constant disconnect affect a lot of comcast customer and the only fix seem to be have the firmware flash back to the aug 2011 because the jan 2012 firmware be faulty . unfortunately , none of the tech support people that i get in touch would be knowledgeable enough to help . of the two linksys and cisco tech i speak to , neither be able to even give i the default password for the modem status page . the dpc3008 maybe certified by comcast but neither comcast nor any part of cisco or linksys will provide support for it . this modem do not have a log page to see what go wrong and there be no interface or even download site for the user to change the firmware . also , when the modem be hang up or if the internet status be disconnect , there be no way to reach the modem status page through a browser via the ip address 192.168.100.1 . all the other cable modem i have use before -lrb- scientific atlanta , motorola surfboard , and linksys cm100 -rrb- all be reachable even when the internet connection be down . with this one , you can not even check the status and there be no log to troubleshoot with . if you be with comcast , stay away from this modem because the certified for comcast label on this modem be meaningless and you 'll get no help from the manufacturer .
240	CableModem	NEG	1	i be look to upgrade to a docsis 3.0 i do a lot of research and this seem like the best choice , over the sb6120 and the 6580 , because i already own a linsys e2000 . after some troubleshooting over the phone with comcast , i have to exchange it for another modem because it keep restart itself . well the second one be do the same thing . i be not gonna try a third one , motorolum release a bad modem . gonna try the 6120 next , it have the same firmware and docsis 3.0
165	CableModem	NEG	1	the modem be sell as `` new '' but when attempt to connect the modem to my cable account the modem be still tie to another person 's account . i waste three hour try to install a item thatius have no choice but to return and deal with the hassel of return and wait for a replacement .
641	CableModem	NEG	1	my linksys cm100 modem die after less than 12 hour of use . it work fine when the cable technician setup we service . but the next morning , there be no light on the modem . probably a thermal issue with the power supply cause premature death . i could not return the defective unit to amazon because the package be open and more than 30 day have elapse since the purchase -lrb- we have to wait a long time to get the house wiring ready for cable -rrb- . so , i contact cisco\/linksys customer service . they determine that the modem be defective and issue a rma . they make i pay to return they defective modem to they . and the replacement they send out be remanufactured -lrb- scratch - no user manual -rrb- . think about this from a customer 's perspective : linksys manufacture a defective product . linksys make the customer pay the shipping cost to return the defective product . linksys send out a use , refurbish replacement . poor business practice if you ask i .
155	CableModem	NEG	1	do not buy this modem because it do not last more than 1 month !!! first i see it be not bad . . but after all the light be not flash . . it become the worst thing to buy . the price be not very cheep . `` touchstone cable modem wbm760a '' be better if you use comcast !
426	CableModem	NEG	1	disappoint with motorola for this one . the modem begin fail just after the one year warranty expire . i replace it with a cisco .
802	CableModem	NEG	1	when i go to set it up with comcast i do everything right but comcast could not get the mac address to work . on this unit . i have a feeling this unit be in a plane box for other reason than save the planet .
700	CableModem	NEG	1	i purchase two of these item about a year ago . they work great !!! unfortunatelly , they both fail after be in service for about a year . i have since then switch to viewsonics signal booster , which have be in service for about six month . i feel that viwsonic be a better product , and it be also less expensive .
8	CableModem	NEG	1	i buy this modem so that i could rid of the $ 7 monthly rent . it get provision fine but keep on get reset every now and then . in two day time it have be reset on its own like 5-6 time . i buy this modem instead of motorola surfboard as i already have a linksys wrt54g2 router but look like cisco modem be not even compatible with they own router . i have try so many time to hook up this modem with the router but no use . i want to save $ 7 rent but look like that cause i a whole lot of pain and if i continue to use this modem i might have to buy a compatible router worth around $ 60 - $ 70 . so look like to save $ 7 \/ month i be spend $ 170 - $ 180 upfront which do not sound good . i be gonna return this modem today . definitely will not recommend it to use with comcast .
128	CableModem	NEG	1	guy , i buy this about 6 month ago and it just die . do not waste you money and look for something else . i be go to check out a netgear product now .
672	CableModem	NEG	1	this review be two-part , first to amazon as provider and second , to the product itself . note that the `` star rating '' be for the product and not for the provider of the product -lrb- in this case , amazon -rrb- . this be a quick review , as i just want to let amazon , and hopefully , motorollum about the product that i buy . amazon : first of all , amazon do a amazing job send and ship the product . it be very fast , ship the day i order it and arrive two day after . thanks amazon !!! product : motorola surfboard sb6121 i purchase this against my gut feeling vs the older sibling sb6120 . while i understand that performance wise , it be -lrb- technically -rrb- similar . after read many review , and check spec , i find out that the sb6121 and sb6120 use the same firmware . however , what really entice i to get this be the fact that it be `` greener '' . however , i be extremely disappoint with the product . it come brand new , seal , with all the proper documentation and part . but the modem will not stay `` on '' and stable for more than 1 minute . the modem will boot up , sync for a few second and then will reboot again . my line be pretty clean , use my current cisco dpc3000 cable modem , i get -1.2 db on downstream power , and 37 snr on downstream on all 4 channel , and with 49.5 db on upstream power . my cisco modem be stable , no reboot nor reset , but i be pay $ 7\/mo so this have to go . unfortunately , motorolla can not even stay still long enough for i to activate the modem at comcast . the modem will boot up , and i 'll be able to load the comcast activation page , and then it will suddenly reboot . i can not get past the page where i need to enter my account number because the modem would have reboot by then . call comcast prove futile as well , as they say that they can not get anything useful from they monitoring end . while they see activity , it will quickly go out and that be because the modem keep reboot and loose sync . it may be a faulty power brick , or a faulty modem . either way , i do not like a faulty brand new equipment . i pay good money and i expect the product to perform as expect . contact amazon for a replacement , here 's hope it will arrive as fast as the original order . if it fail again , i will not be waste amazon 's stock anymore and just replace it with the older -lrb- and cheaper -rrb- sb6120 version .
770	CableModem	NEG	1	for the first 3 month this modem work like a charm . after that , it start have problem . i replace the splitter and the cable to the modem with no luck . i go through all the reset procedure over and over again . there be no problem with the incoming cable signal . it be strong . i contact the manufacturer this morning and they inform i that they do not help private user\/owners ... only cable company who buy they product by the thousand . then she hang up on i . with -lrb- non -rrb- customer service like that , my recommendation be to look elsewhere . too bad ... i really like it those first 3 month .
303	CableModem	NEG	2	i have be through 3 motorola surfboard sb6121 modem within the past 2 day . purchase product at local retailer . before i upgrade to the docsis 3.0 modem and package , i be use the motorola docsis 2.0 12 mbp down\/2 mbp up package with comcast . with the powerboost feature the device average 19-20 mbp down\/4 mbp up . after the upgrade to the docsis 3.0 and 20 mbp down\/4 mbp up package , the new modem average speed of 30-31 mbp down\/1 -2.5 mbp up . there be time the device would peak at 3 mbp up , but that be a best case scenario . as you can see , this be very frustrating know that you upload speed be not at least on par with you old device and performance package . several folk from comcast state that the signal strength and ping to the docsis 3.0 be good . however , one tech do a line test and the result come back that a tech need to be send to the residence . the tech come out and find nothing wrong with the line . the docsis 3.0 continue to give a dismal performance while the tech be present . he test a arris docsis 3.0 modem he have in the truck and it perform flawlessly ; 31 mbp down\/4 mbp up . the device he have perform as it should . btw , from what i can tell `` yes '' the tech on the phone and at the residence provision the device correctly . i take back the modem i have to the store and pick up another one . the second modem could not be see on comcast 's network so i hurry back to the store before it close and pick up another one from another location just in case i be pick up modem from a bad batch . needless to say , the third modem perform the same and i now have the old docsis 2.0 back on the network . i be back to get my great speed . btw , i also test to see if there be any difference in speed between the 2.0 and 3.0 with the playstation 3 . the 2.0 still outperform the 3.0 . i just do not know what it be with the 3.0 . it be as if this device will work flawlessly for most people who may or may not be aware of they speed before upgrade . however , i be not impressed enough to keep the docsis 3.0 .
216	CableModem	NEG	1	i be sure this unit work , but i get a lemon , and for that reason , i be annoyed and make sure you know it . the `` receive '' signal do not work , despite call to motorola and comcast . they all confirm it be in fact defective . brand new , out of the box defective . thanks motorola !
630	CableModem	NEG	1	purchase this item to replace my `` end-of-life '' cable modem and have nothing but problem . it disconnect every couple of hour and have to be reset . this be not very convenient when work from home and be downright impossible when i be away from home and try to access my system remotely . my internet provider tell i they have have nothing but problem with this brand of modem and they find it to be incompatible with they system -- even though the manufacturer claim it be .
806	CableModem	NEG	1	just get this in the mail . horrible connection and super slow compare to the arris i be rent from comcast for $ 7\/mo . i be consider keep the rental and suck up the fee just to get decent internet . ca not even stream video from youtube \/ etc without it buffer every 5 seconds . sad .
153	CableModem	NEG	1	i buy this so i do not have to pay the leasing fee with comcast but it would never keep a stable connection . modem would reset every minute so it be basically useless . back to amazon it go .
17	CableModem	NEG	2	i have have my modem for 2 year and it just now conk out on i for no reason -lrb- everytime i would try to upload to the internet , it would reset my connection -rrb- . i suppose i still come out ahead of pay $ 5\/mo in rent to comcast , but i have hope this product would last longer than this . i have be optimistic about zoom give the review , but do not plan to buy from they again .
683	CableModem	NEG	2	receive my arris wbm760a modem from this seller . the unit work just fine . however , when the comcast technician come out to install it , he say that the modem have be provision by another cable company and that while it may work , there be a chance that the unit would stop work if charter -lrb- the other cable company -rrb- decide to re-provision it . in other word , this be use . i feel that this information should be clearly mark on the item description . i be not take any chance , this will be straight back for a return .
546	CableModem	NEG	2	i could not get this modem to work . comcast technician could not figure out what be wrong with it . i do not think this modem work for everyone .
211	CableModem	NEG	2	i buy this product a few day ago from a local microcenter . microcenter have two modem available , this one and the zoom docsis 3.0 . the zoom be 10 dollar cheaper . i never hear of zoom so i decide to go with linksy since i feel they be the trust name . i do not want to end up get what i pay for . take it home , register my mac and sn online through comcast and have some problem in the begin then everything work fine . i be able to watch a movie on netflix without any issue . then the problem come on my first day work from home . like other have state it repeatedly drop connection and then reconnect . this become extremely annoying quickly as i use virtualbox to boot windows on my mac and then remote desktop to my work pc . i would be in the middle of typing and then the cursor would stop . i could not click any of the window . that be when i know the connection drop . sometimes the connection would reconnect quickly enough to avoid windows make i reconnect manually . that be when i come here to see if anyone be have the same problem and surely enough they have ! i take this back to microcenter and get the zoom . so far no issue but will have to wait and see . i be hope the positive review on the zoom be consistent . my suggestion be to avoid any product that have inconsistent result and report from a number of user .
860	CableModem	NEG	1	when i install this between my cable box and the cable from the wall , it do nothing to improve the picture , so i try it at the other end of the cable-where it come out of the wall . got no picture at all that way . so , useless to i .
633	CableModem	NEG	2	june 13 , 2012 the modem do not connect to comcast server , and the representative that be try to install it say that it be defective . i be currently try to exchange it for a new one , because base on the other review this seem to be a solid product , and i just get unlucky . update , july 8 , 2012 i finally receive my replacement modem after more than two week . i have to pay to ship it back to digital media source , and additionally have to lease a modem from the cable company while i do not have one . overall this be a slow and expensive return\/exchange process , but the fact that i now have a function modem bump this from one star to two .
334	CableModem	NEG	1	this modem be not good for comcast user . since i switch it this modem , i have so many problem with slow internet speed , and drop connection everyday . do not buy this if you be comcast user !!
452	CableModem	NEG	1	modem work fine for 90 day and then die . unit be plug into a high end ups\/line buffer along with the other network equipment . would not recommend this to anyone .
738	CableModem	NEG	1	i buy this modem back in may , 2012 and for the first couple of month it work great . in the last couple of week it now frequently lose connection or be very slow . it make my cable internet -lrb- with comcast -rrb- slower than surf with my phone and be very frustrating .
340	CableModem	NEG	1	buy it half a month ago because of its tempting low price -lrb- around $ 20 -rrb- to replace the rental modem from comcast . sadly however i try it do not work at all . finally i get a comcast technician who confirm it be not my problem but this gadget 's . also , the power cable with it be not original and do not match up -lrb- 0.8 a require vs 1a by the cable -rrb- .
222	CableModem	NEG	1	i have have numerous cable router but none have so many connection issue like this one . get a signal be completely hit or miss -lrb- mostly miss -rrb- , and this be on a wire connection , i do not even bother try wireless before return .
515	CableModem	NEG	1	it work fine for couple week till i buy a router , then i notice drop of connection so i be not sure if it be the modem itself or it doesnt work properly with the router but i be definitely return this useless modem .
215	CableModem	NEG	1	just do not help at all . make the picture worse , may have be defective so i send back . just get a good splitter from the local electronics store and it help much more than the signal booster .
396	CableModem	NEG	1	this modem do not work . have to have a technician come out to determine why internet be not work ; turn out to be the modem .
352	CableModem	NEG	1	i try to connect it to my exist router that be also make by linksys\/cisco . it do not work . i call linksys support hope that since both modem and router be by the same company , they would help . the lady on the support line tell i since the router be out of warranty , we need to charge $ 40 to configure it for you over the phone . this may include firmware upgrade as well . i then return the modem and purchase a d-link modem . it work out of the box without require any change in my router . i be very surprised and unhappy with linksys\/cisco . first , the modem be brand new and they try to shift the issue to router . second , they build both product and there be no mention or warn that the modem do not work with older linksy router . third , d-link modem work without require any change in router . this mean linksys\/cisco break interoperability and try to charge for fix it . linksys be now in my blacklist . when i upgrade my router - to be do shortly - , i will shop for non-linksys brand .
437	CableModem	NEG	1	two in a row come dead on arrival . both would turn on and begin a power cycling loop , turn themselves off every minute or so . i would do quite a lot of research before pick this modem , quietly hope that the known power cycling issue would not affect this batch , but it be not the case . amazon handle the shipment and return promptly , but it simply be not to be . after two return and hour waste on the phone with comcast support , i give up and buy a different model . even a trivial amount of quality assurance should have catch this issue so i be far less than impressed with motorola 's effort on this model .
837	CableModem	NEG	1	set up a new comcast account , i have go through two attempt with motorola modem . the first be the sb6020 , which be doa -- would not even power up . send it back and decide to try the sb6121 , to see if they newer model perhaps have better quality control . i think i be go to have success -- the light come on -- but no luck . the first strike against this modem come when i call comcast to try to do a `` self-install '' to save the service charge of the technician come out . in we new place , i know the previous tenant have use comcast , so i be sure the house be already wire correctly . comcast be unable to do a self-install over the phone for this modem , so a technician be send out . the comcast technician , a nine-year veteran installer , spend over a hour fight with the sb6121 , try to get it to initialize . we wire it in directly , remove all splitter , etc. . . and it still refuse to recognize . keep cycling and drop service . i spend another hour on the phone with motorola tech support , who be unable to help . finally , as a last resort , the comcast technican plug in a similar docsis 3.0 modem from he truck . the connection be up and work in seconds , with a stable signal and no drop service . of course , i be now fight with comcast over the $ 99 service charge for the technician . all tell , this modem have cost i 3-4 hour of my life and $ 99 already ... and this be my second return of a motorola modem to amazon in less than 10 day . and i still need a modem . with the dubious quality of the current generation of motorola modem , they have lose i as a customer for the forseeable future . if the next model be better , i 'll revisit the issue but for now , the aggravation and expense just be not worth it .
858	CableModem	NEG	1	this modem only last 7 week and rarely work correctly during that time . very disappointed that i didnt keep box so i cant send back
365	CableModem	NEG	1	i receive a package with the cable modem , 1 usb cable , and 1 ethernet cable , but no power adapter . i be now look into return the package for a full refund .
272	CableModem	NEG	2	i must have get one of the monday morning one . work for less than one year . last few week continue to crash -lrb- drop signal -rrb- . i wonder about all the five star rating when i see the number of refurbish unit for sale . i must not be the only one experience a defective unit . when it work it work well ; however , i expect to get more than one year service from the unit .
869	CableModem	NEG	1	this modem work for a couple of week . and now it be not . i be not sure what be wrong with it , but it be definitely defective .
453	CableModem	NEG	1	stop work after a couple day of heavy usage ... begin to get really slow after a few minute of usage . we regularly have multiple hd video stream go since we cancel the cable . : -rrb- at the very least , there be almost always something access the internet here . -lrb- it could have be we isp mess with we , since we stop rent they modem , but that be just speculation ... -rrb-
464	CableModem	NEG	2	got first sb6121 unit in prep for move to new house . comcast tech groan when he hear i have `` motorola docsis 3 '' because of they extraordinarily long set-up time . tech wait around for more than 70min after plugging-in modem to coax & power . keep cycling power-on , sync ` ing , then power-off - repeat . tech claim be download firmware . as a `` geek class 5 ~ 6 '' -lrb- of 10 -rrb- who be i to argue as he do this for living . he be on phone with comcast office with acronym , blah-blah while look at diagnostic tool . modem would link-up with internet long enough to see comcast registration\/activation webpage , only to shut-down again . grrrr ! finally tech say must be bad unit - replace . got rental `` ubee 3.0 '' from van & i be on in -lrb- 5 min . amazon to rescue with great replacement service . last night started-over with 2nd new mtrola sb6121 - same thing ! go to bed with unit connect to coax & power hope any `` firmware '' download would sort-themselve by morning . unit stable in morning , until i plugged-in cat5e to computer - cycle back ! grrrr ! contact comcast . give they the basics you would expect : serial # , mac # , account info . they register modem detail on they side . they instruct i to reconnect mtrla & my computer -lrb- include router between -rrb- . do so . launch browser . activation page stable & hit authorization . modem cycle ! -lrb- `` oh carp ''  , i think -rrb- ... but thank god . . when modem come back-up authorization complete & now stable & equivalent speed as rental ubee . be my ~ 4th modem and by far the most aggravating process ! who be to blame ? motorola , tech , comcast system ? no idea ... at least work now . better luck to you
389	CableModem	NEG	1	i be use this modem with with comcast and a linksys ea4500 router and it constantly drop the internet connection . sometimes i have to unplug and plug back in the modem multiple time per hour . there be huge thread you can find online in which ton of people have describe they problem with this modem . i be extremely disappoint in cisco and i warn people to stay away from this modem . the kind of problem this modem cause be really unacceptable and customer should not put up with be treat so badly , especially after they have pay a fairly high price for it .
771	CableModem	NEG	1	i learn not to assume anything about technical material . i have search amazon for a specific cisco modem , and this one come up . it be a cisco cm-100 , which accord to comcast 's list of recommend modem be not a recommend model . i could not determine what model it be until i open the package and soon learn that i would get to pay return postage . if it do not list a model number , there likely be a reason , and i presume that in this case , the reason be that it be not on comcast 's list !
258	CableModem	NEG	1	i buy this so i could return my rental i be pay to comcast for the $ 7\/month modem . when i plug the modem in , there be a connection but no internet access . i end up call comcast and i read they my hfc mac id # and turn out that this modem be currently register under someone else and they could not register under my name . after hear that , i be frustrated and angry that i buy this and hope i can get my full refund back and will never buy from they again .
118	CableModem	NEG	1	i purchase this modem for a new apartment that i be set up the internet and cable for . it meet all of the comcast requirement list on they site and the installation technician laud i for think ahead and have the hardware ready for he when he arrive . that be , until he try to hook it up . the modem simply refuse to connect to the comcast network . after try a few different set up to no avail he go out to he truck and bring in a replacement modem . same brand , same model , even the same packaging . the big difference be that he work right of the bat . so long story short , i be stuck pay a monthly rental fee from comcast and this modem in on its way back to amazon .
430	CableModem	NEG	1	unreliable connection to netgear 's own n600 router . nightmare tech service . b and no resolution . purchase this modem to run on comcast with netgear n600 router . be tell 1 -rrb- need to reset all setting on router to work properly with this modem and want to sell i $ 79 support package for 7 month to help with this -- would not tell i what setting 2 -rrb- be tell that as a loyal customer , they would help i 3 -rrb- after 15 minute of escalation to `` loyal customer program '' , repeat all info , be again offer the $ 79 package , this time for 6 month 4 -rrb- tell i that firmware on router would fix the problem -lrb- i already have intstall latest firmware -rrb- 5 -rrb- be lie to about need to install new `` software '' on router , in addition to firmware and gui , which have already be upgrade . as far as i can tell , there be no additional `` software '' . waste of time and money . problem still not fix . customer insult with harangue for up-charge support and misinformation .
721	CableModem	NEG	1	lack feature . poor documentation . no support . i be upgrade from dsl to cable internet and purchase this modem to avoid the high charge my cable company want to charge i for a modem and wifus . while this modem may work for most people , i find it lack router feature that most router have . i have two computer that run different application that require port forwarding from the router to work . i could only port forward to one computer at a time . if i put the second computer in dmz then i could not even port forward to the first computer . when i call motorola for support they tell i i need a older firmware to make it work for i and to contact my cable company to have it download to my modem . why would anyone remove functionality from they firmware ? bad move on motorola 's part . when i call the cable company , they would not touch it since it be not there modem . in other word no one be willing to support this modem . the only other fix be to put the modem into bridge mode and use a second router that would handle the port forwarding . give the cost of this modem why would i want to use it just as a modem ? i also find the documentation for the modem both online and that package with the unit to be lack . there be multiple box that could be modify that do not have any explanation or description in the documentation . if all you need to do be use wireless to connect a laptop this modem will probably work for you . if you need to do anything more than that you may have problem . if you need support , forget it . motorola will not update firmware . the cable company will not update the firmware . in the end i have return this modem to amazon.com and rent a basic modem from my cable company that i be use with my router . at least this way the cable company will support the modem and the router manufacture can not hide behind the cable company .
202	CableModem	NEG	1	note : this review be not to criticize the modem . it work fine . however , beware of purchase from seller ` portable guy ' . the modem they ship i be `` new '' just 4 + year old . i could not get my laptop to reccognise the modem so i call cisco . after give the operator the serial number i be tell the modem be so old they no longer support it and the manufacture warranty expire 26 month ago . thanks for the burn , a \*\*\*\*\* e.
62	CableModem	NEG	1	i have have a motorola sb5100 for 7 year and never have any trouble with it . after 7 year i figure it be time to upgrade so i decide to buy a sb6121 . it be motorola it have to be good right ? wrong . it come and i connect it to my cox cable no problem and it work great , for about a day . the speed be noticeably faster than the sb5100 , but then i get a error message say i have no internet connection . i think in my 7 year with the sb5100 i might have get that message 7 time . i look at the sb6121 and all the light be off . it do not seem like it be get power . i check to see if it be plug in and it be . so i unplug it and plug it back in and it reboot no problem . long story short it keep do this for a couple of week and sometimes it would reboot and sometimes it would not reboot until after many try or many hour . i call motorola tech support and we do a factory reset on it and that do not help . the motorola tech say it sound like a hardware problem . unfortunately , since i do not buy it from amazon i could not return it . that $ 10 i save do not look like such a good deal now . so i go back to my 7 year old sb5100 . this seem like a good , fast modem while it work but unfortunately that be not very long . i have read a few review which say they have the same problem but i just figure they have get a lemon . i would like to get another one but i think i will wait awhile and hope motorola fix what seem to be a too common problem .
870	CableModem	NEG	1	just google for ` cisco dpc3008 customer support ' and you 'll see that one of the top hit be the comcast customer forum where hundred of people complain about the dpc3008 drop internet connection . because this modem be list on comcast 's web site as a approve modem , i buy one 3 month ago . i have have nothing but trouble with it and to my surprise , discover that many other people be experience the same problem . under somewhat heavy load such as streaming a movie , the modem drop the internet connection . the only solution be to use a different modem . i replace the dpc3008 with a motorola surfboard and have not have any problem . i would stay away from the dpc3008 , it do not work reliably . it 'll be the last cisco product i ever purchase .
366	CableModem	NEG	1	i buy this modem since comcast give it three star out of three for compatibility with docsis 3.0 . it work great for two month . for the past week the modem lose connection to the internet after fifteen minute . in order to not lose connection i have to keep a persistent ping run to the internet . even with this measure i can not stream video without it have pause when the timeout occur . i have comcast out my house to look at my wiring . they replace several connector , but the problem still persist . there be no reason for this to happen after tqo month . there be no support page on motorola 's website . i can only check the internal ip of the modem and restart it from there . the only other option be a factory reset of the device . since two month have pass i can not return it .
678	CableModem	NEG	1	it seem people who buy this modem and could not get a signal from they isp comcast be because of the modem itself be defective . i have charter and mine could not get a signal from they as well . tech on the phone be try to provision the modem but could not get a signal . i have to put back on my sb6120 modem and tech re-provision it , it work right away .
552	CableModem	NEG	1	this product be a steal item . i have to return . i have to pay 10 % for nothing . no worth to buy . i highly recommend do not buy .
836	CableModem	NEG	1	no dice , try to get the modem to work with multiple comcast tech . never could be recognize on there system despite be on the master list .
235	CableModem	NEG	2	this product be great ... for 6 month . then it fail completely . i can access the modem from my pc , but can not get through to the internet . fortunately i still have the old sb4200 from year ago . it be slower , but it still work . okay , 3 day later , i reconnect the sb6121 modem and it work fine . it do drop this morning -lrb- 8\/15 -rrb- but after turn the power off and back on , reconnect with no problem . it be a bit of a puzzle but for now , i be back to be satisfy . until the next time !?!
336	CableModem	NEG	1	absolutely terrible ! do not reach all area of we house -lrb- and its not a big house -rrb- and cant . handle multiple device . im disappointed and we be go to bee look for something better !
967	CableModem	NEG	1	buy it for my the comcast cable internet . comcast have certify this . and the box in which this come boldly display the certify by comcast mark . but it barely work i keep have trouble like lose connection and finally one day it completely stop work . the comcast technician who visit my place tell i many other people face the same problem with this one but comcast refuse to officially remove this from the list of certified modem . finally now i be use a surfboard and it do not have any problem .
594	CableModem	NEG	2	i buy this modem after extensive research and the great product review . it be a `` 3 star '' rate approved modem for comcast\/xfinity . the self setup be dead simple - connect the cable input to the modem , power up and let it sync with the signal . then i directly connect the modem to my laptop and `` fire up '' the browser which take i to the activation page for comcast . inpute the information request -lrb- account no. , mac id , phone number -rrb- and activate the modem . in less than 30 minute i be online with blaze speed . i than connect my router to the modem and the network be up and run . i be amaze and really pleased with myself , comcast and motorola . the modem perform great for a few hour , than the problem start . i lose connection and signal sync . ok - decide to do a hard restart : i disconnect the modem , disconnect the power and the cable . do a hard restart , reconnect the cable and ethernet and be back online - for about one hour . i lose connection again . call comcast - good tech support who check thing at he end and instruct i to do another hard restart . i be back online for the rest of the evening . however , when i get up in the morning i be again offline . at that point i check the comcast broadband forum for some answer . this be a known issue with many user of the sb6121 and be trace to the quality of the signal from the isp . if the signal be less than ideal -lrb- snr , power level -rrb- any noise will kick you offline and the modem will not self recover . you will have to do a hard restart each time to get back online . when online , you 'll get great internet speed . but you 'll suffer from frequent disconnect and the need to reboot the modem . aside from the inconvenience , the need for frequent hard reboot can not be good for the durability of the modem . so unless you have good signal quality from the isp i would recommend you buy another modem . in my case -lrb- after research the user forum -rrb- , i switch to a zoom 5341j . so far after 2 day - no problem . by the way , after look at the certification rating on the xfinity\/comcast approved modems list more closely , i learn the `` star '' be not a measure of quality or performance of the modem . the star be a measure of the level of test the modem have go through during certification . each star be another level of testing . in summary - the motorola sb6121 be a good modem but maybe too sensitive the signal quality for some user .
848	CableModem	NEG	1	this device will sporadically lag packet - they typically all get through but some be delay . isp can not send firmware update once the onboard chip be full . too old for modern network .
414	CableModem	NEG	1	i buy this item through fry 's for a little bit more , but i need a cable modem right away . i get home think i get a deal , and for the first two month , i do . for the last two week the cable modem have be drop the carrier signal about twice a day . for regular browse this would not be a big deal , but it become a hassle to start netflix movie over and to repeatedly get kick out of game . i have contact customer service , but do not have a resolution yet . i will keep you post . the verdict : - easy to use and set up - perform well when it work - have a life span of 2 month save yourself the time and buy a cable modem that cost $ 20 more . you will be happier in the long run .
850	CableModem	NEG	1	product be refurbish . wish i would have see the other review before purchase . the ac adapter include be a dud - rather than deal with the hassle of return it , i simply use a old adapter that i just happen to have , then it work fine . many time refurbish product be not such a bad idea - the item have supposedly be test after be send back to the manufacturer , but after this i will never buy a linksys refurbish product . shame on amazon.com for not clearly state such a important detail in the description .
316	CableModem	NEG	2	modem would restart itself all the time and recently have be do it more often . finally i say forget it and be use the cisco one provide to i by my internet provider rcn . i initially do not realize it be the modem , once i do it be outside of the return window . i do plan to call amazon and see what they can do though .
378	CableModem	NEG	1	i order this in may . it be now august . i have have trouble with this product since i get it and have call the modem maker tech desk for help . i be tell to contact comcast about my internet connection . comcast tell i they would charge i to come out and look . after one recent day of over a dozen drop connection , i have comcast come out . they tell i the modem be defective . so now , i not only have a charge from comcast , it be too late to return this $ 70 piece of junk . and when i try to go through amazon to contact the seller about this purchase , i be block by a message that it be `` too late '' .
558	CableModem	NEG	1	stinks , be a lousy modem , give less than 1\/2 speed advertise . i be gonna try buy.com instead . or ebay , shopping.com , of anyone other than amd .
325	CableModem	NEG	1	the first one i be with comcast for two hour try to put the modem on line but the modem be keep reset it self every 20-50 seconds . exchange the modem and the second one be do the same thing but with 1-5 minute . will look for something else ... .
95	CableModem	NEG	1	i buy this because charter recommend upgrade to a docsis 3.0 modem for better performance and this seem to be the best -lrb- costliest -rrb- available . disappointment ! installation be not smooth . on replace the modem , charter could not restart the modem remotely , so i have to do it manually . that itself do not seem right . i see a slight speed improvement compare to my 5-year old modem , though nothing to justify the 95 buck i have shell out for this . after a week or so , it just disconnect and i could not get it to re-connect . charter detect some bad signal come from the modem . i go back to my ubee old modem which work fine . after a day later , hope that it be just a temporary glitch , i install the sb6121 again and it work fine for another week after which it again just disconnect . it be as if it need a day off every few day !! i can not afford to give pay vacation to modem , so i ditch it and return it to amazon .
2	CableModem	NEG	1	we subscribe to comcast high speed internet service and have enjoy it far more than we battle with verizon . we have a motorola modem before and it work great for a couple of year - until friday , june 15th , we could not get a connection for any longer than 30-45 seconds before the modem would restart itself over and over and over . the service rep at comcast infer that we must have a bad modem so we buy a brand new motorola surfboard 6121 and we have the same problem ! we bring out the comcast technician who test the line and assure we that the line be good but the modem be not work right . so i get a second new surfboard 6121 modem and that do not work either !! we daughter , who also have comcast , tell we that they have a arris 7640 modem and so we order that . the arris modem come and presto , it work . i always think that motorola be a excellent modem but , for some reason , they be not compatible with comcast in massachusetts . good luck - i know how frustrate it be .
843	CableModem	NEG	2	i order this modem instead of the sb6120 because of the problem report in connect to comcast . unfortunately this modem do not connect to comcast . motorolla inform i that the isp must download a file specific to the give modem . since this be not yet on the list of approve modem . there be no file and it can not connect , although they do tell i the signal be excellent . hence : do not order this modem for use with comcast unless they tell you it be compatible ...
585	CableModem	NEG	1	work good for about 9 mo . then no reception at all try everything . i even re route it use new rg6 cable and even try just one tv this be use for my cable tv !
203	CableModem	NEG	1	i purchase this product a month before move into a new house . once we move in we set everything up , and the product be extremely unreliable . at least 5 time a day , vary from 5 to 30 minute , the modem would drop the signal . we be not sure if the problem be the modem or the cable , so we purchase another modem and we have not have any problem since then . unfortunately , because we buy the product so far in advance of we move , we can not return it now either . we would not recommend this product .

139	CableModem	NEG	1	like most here , i have purchase this modem to replace rental modem from comcast -lrb- $ 7\/month -rrb- . like few here , when i set the modem up , it would keep resete itself in 2-4 minute . when modem be only connect to the cable , it be look good , all light be on , but as soon as i connect the computer either directly or through the router , the connection would not last long , light would turn off and connection procedure would restart , then they would stay on for few minute and whole cycle would repeat . i be unable to finish the self registration because the modem would restart itself around the same time i submit the first screen , on few occasion i get through to the 2nd or once even 3rd screen . i have try with two laptop either directly or via modem but to no awail . after read review from similarly affect people here and elsewhere on the web , even though it may well be just the one instance i get , i have decide to return the modem completely and not ask for the replacement . instead , i have order the same modem i be rent from comcast and have no problem with : `` ubee ddm3513 docsis 3.0 cable modem '' . it should arrive today so i be really curious if i make the right choice . i wish comcast have some kind of ` lease to buy ' program or option to purchase the equipment you be rent . update : ubee dm3513 modem work like charm right out of the box , with self registration i be up and run in about 10 minute .
421	CableModem	NEG	1	please do not buy this product ignore those negative review . this router disconnect frequently at random interval and its very frustrating , my old 20 $ refurbish modem work 100 time better than this one . too expensive for the hurdle and pain you have to go through after pay $ 90 for this router . not worth you time and money at all !!!!!! note : my internet work normal with my old refurbish router .
236	CableModem	NEG	2	i buy this modem after my motorola surfboard keep drop out . this one be more stable for the first few month , but after that i notice a sharp decline in my upload speed -lrb- it go from around 2mbp to .15 mbp -rrb- . after fight with my cable company for a few week and try just about everything i could think of to fix the problem , i finally decide to try switch it out with my old surfboard modem . this fix the issue . there be no doubt in my mind that this modem be the problem . i would not recommend this product and i be currently look for a new modem .
992	CableModem	NEG	2	i select this modem after consult my cable provider 's list of recommend modem . in fact , i just get off the phone with my provider 's tech support , and i confirm what i find when i try to install this modem : if you receive voice telephony service in addition to internet and tv service , this modem will not work . period . there be no phone jack . my cable provider 's website be in error . -lrb- i be tell that there be very few modem that support both cable and telephone . -rrb- do not let this happen to you . fair warning .
891	CableModem	NEG	1	have i find this comcast forum post at -lrb- ... -rrb- , i would not have buy dpc3008 . cisco dpc3000 work fine earlier . now , i have no support for resolve drop connection issue with this dpc3008 . comcast keep reset and tell no log of any disconnection activity . cisco on the other hand be not tell what be with the firmware that people be talk on the comcast forum . both company need to figure out the fix to this problem soon . update -lrb- april 18 2012 -rrb- : comcast revert back the firmware build date to aug 11 2011 and it fix the drop connection issue . definitely , this would change my opinion on the product to excellent .
543	CableModem	NEG	1	this amp do not work with the latest cable modem such as motorola sb 6120 . the amplifier definitely boost the tv signal as i can verify that signal-to-noise ratio increase from around 32 db to 40 db . however , the amp seem to either block full bi-directional communication or filter out require frequency for the cable modem to make online connection to isp -lrb- in my case comcast -rrb- . furthermore , the vendor 's -lrb- cabletvamps.com -rrb- 's support be a joke . when i ask why it be not work with my cable modem , the reply be a copy\/paste of some unrelated topic about the amp not support satellite tv and i should return the product . main reason i purchase the booster be to split to both cable modem and tv without drop signal strength to the cable modem , but that be not possible with this junk . i be back to use a simple -3.5 db splitter that support upto 1,000 mhz update ! - the cabletvamps support finally reply : quote : `` the motorola s2 be a passive return unit - these be not design to be use with cable modems as they will not support the signal . you will need a active return amplifier -lrb- the motorola k4 be a 4-port unit -rrb- which will support a cable modem and any interactive service -lrb- ondemand , etc. -rrb- that the cable company offer ''
521	CableModem	NEG	2	i have time warner 50mb\/s service . this modem will not work with that service , at least not in los angeles . it top out at about 30mb\/s . i have they connect by they modem and the speed shoot back up to 50mb\/s steady . they do not care one way or another which modem i use . it will work with the standard road runner service , but not the beef up service .
252	CableModem	NEG	1	this be a update after own the modem for just over 30 day : originally give 4 stars , i have reduce the rating to 1 star . the modem die after a month of use . that leave i stick without service for several day until the weekend could pass and the cable company technician check what the problem be with my internet service . after a great deal of checking and cross checking , a new motorola modem be put in by my cable guy . they sell it for $ 75 -lrb- as oppose to amazon 's $ 50 -rrb- but offer 1 year on-site warranty with immediate replacement and installation of a problem unit - not so bad a deal if you really need to be online for certain . the new motorola surfboard sb5101 be instantly recognize by my linksys router - so the problem describe below with instalation of the linksys cable modem wre not encounter . it strike i as odd that there would be less compatability between a linksys router and modem than between a linksys router and motorola modem . i get a linksys modem because of the good review , but also because i think it would `` play nice '' with my linksys router . my router be the wrt610n dual n-band so it be pretty good . when i get the modem i plug it in and give the mac address to my cable company . however , i could not get on the itnernet ; my cable company supply modem have work fine - i just get tire of pay the rental . they have i direct connect the modem to the computer - no problem . the problem be with the router ! the modem and router do not play nice together at all ! since my router be just over a year old , my call to linksys let i know they could tell i how to configure the router to get it work ... but it would cost $ 29 . to do so . they product do not work so well together , so they charge to make they work ! i refuse to pay . i get out my linksys router cd , look up my router login and password and other info , then re-install the router . the reinstallation process fix it up so it get on the internet . if you get this modem and have a router , be prepare for a little hassle get it go . first impression of the modem after get it operational with the router be that it seem to provide faster internet access than the old modem from the calbe company do - though only marginally so , but still enopugh to notice . this seem to be a excellent modem and work really well . but , if you have a linksys wrt610n -lrb- and probably any other linksys router -rrb- be prepare for a little extra work to get the modem go .
277	CableModem	NEG	1	i purchase this motorola bda-s1 and it die a few day after i receive it . amazon ask i to deal with the company that sell it through amazon , cabletvamps.com and they be impossible to get in touch with . i be not too happy with they return policy either . look like i be get screw on this one .
119	CableModem	NEG	2	buy it for my mom last fall because my brother -lrb- the electronics geek -rrb- say dont get two separate unit ... so i take back the two separate unit that work well , and get this nightmare . as soon as we hook it up it begin reject any and all other device . spend over three week off and on -lrb- approx 25 hr -rrb- with tech support , finally accept internet through cable tv . it be still reject the brand new printer\/fax machine that be also suppose to be compatible . i wish i just leave well enough alone . the space she save be not worth the hassle , and it cost i $ 10 more than the other unit .
745	CableModem	NEG	1	i have be use a motorola sb5120 -lrb- mostly happily -rrb- for a couple of year and plan on upgrade we network start with a new docsis 3.0 cable modem , the motorola sb6121 . today i just try install my second modem from amazon after the first give i the cycle-on , cycle-off problem some of the reviewer have mention . sadly the second one be the same , at least for i . i have to conclude either there be 1 -rrb- a batch of defective modem out there , or 2 -rrb- it really be not compatible with comcast cable in portland , or . there be no point in order a 3rd . comcast do not give i any assistance - as per usual , they first suggestion be i buy the ` wrong ' modem -lrb- tho they do not exactly say that , and the website give it all high mark -rrb- , and they attitude be one where i imagine the service tech greet i with `` hello , this be comcast , how can i help you ? let see we record indicate that you first name be `` moron '' correct ? yes , i think so ... '' -rrb- -lrb- to be fair , he really do not say that and be rather quite pleasant , he just could not offer any meaningful help . he do even call back to check if i work out my problem -rrb- so apart from my comcast minus rant , at this point there be no way i can do better than 1 star for the sb6121 though i wish i could . on the flip side , `` thank you amazon '' for you awesome return policy . this one will be back home with you in a few day .
776	CableModem	NEG	1	i have try 2 unit and both do not sync with comcast . i will return the second unit and try another brand .

105	CableModem	NEG	1	i purchase this modem just under 1 year ago to replace a motorola cm that be fail . the mot sb last approx 3 year , which be pretty average for this type of appliance that be always on . for the last 2 month or so we have be get intermittent connection drop . the drop occur on the service provider side , as indicate by the modem light . reset and removal of power do not help . the drop be get more frequent . i start call cox , my sp , and the odd thing be , that once the call be initiate , the connection seem to work . this work 90 % of the time , then i can just hang up , without talk with anyone . upon speak with customer service , they report that the modem reset itself hundred of time a hour and say that some other technical indication -lrb- he would not elaborate further -rrb- be way off the chart . he recommendation be that the modem be bad and he would need to send a tech out to verify -lrb- and of course sell i a new one -rrb- . i have use other linksys product before and have be happy with they . this be the bottom of the barrel for they engineering team . the modem should last longer than 1 year . the tech on the phone also indicate that he have see these modem fail earlier than other brand . i be hopeful that this linksys product be a contender , but will not buy another .
822	CableModem	NEG	1	do not waste you money . all cable company provide these item for free plus free installation . for those who insist on own one , beware : the modem do not last long . at most 2-3 year and than burn out . happen to i 3 time , the first last a few month , the second 2 year , the last almost a year , when it finally dawn on i : call com ... they come , install , hi-fi have everything . beautiful !! no more worry .

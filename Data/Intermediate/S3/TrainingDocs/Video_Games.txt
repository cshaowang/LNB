705	Video_Games	POS	4	we be a pixar household . my 5-year old son love all thing toy story , and we have watch toy story 2 more time than i care to admit in the company of adult . so when i find myself play buzz lightyear on a attack on zurg 's fortress , straight out of toy story 2 , i be beside myself . and i be 41 . the game be a must-play if you be a toy story fanatic , and simply can not get enough woody , buzz , jessie , and the rest of the gang . it be obvious that they do not get the a-list actor to do the voice , especially when stinky pete open he mouth , but it be still a blast to get to `` be '' woody try to make you way through andy 's room . the game start off fast , with a extend version of the train chase from the beginning of ts3 , and work its way through the rest of the movie with somewhat-related adventure . it be obvious that they have to make up some reason for the game to take 8 + hour , and so some of the mission be a bit off-plot from the film -lrb- s -rrb- . they be still fun , like figure out how to ride bullseye around sunnyside quickly . the thing that make this game 100 % worth the time and money , however , be the attack on zurg 's fortress . flying in as buzz lightyear , take on the robot , and then make my way to the center of the fortress be a blast . and when i get stick and could not make it any further i remember the secret entrance to the left , and sure enough , there it be . of course . for age-appropriate kid , or kid at heart , this game be indeed a fun romp through a land i already know with character i already love . if you be a hardcore gamer , this will make for a good , fun-hearted diversion from you normal gunfight . if you be a pixar junkie , know that you can defeat zurg , too .

656	Video_Games	POS	5	seriously , people , if you have a irrational hate for steam or be too dumb to use it properly - why do you keep buy the game base on it ? the information about this game use steamworks be available long before , anybody willing could research it easily before buy this game . why do you have to show you own stupidity\/laziness by announce that you find out about this game 's steamworks usage only after buy this game ? for the record , i have be use steam service since it be beta stage , on multiple pc -lrb- both windows-based and macos-based -rrb- , i have close to 200 title purchase through it , and i have never , ever have experience any kind of issue when use it almost every day , same go for 100 's of 1000 's of other user . have you ever give a slightest thought that if majority of people be use this service successfully that the problem that you be have be cause by the `` thing '' located between the chair and the keyboard , and not the valve software ? and before you try to critique steam further - guess what ? buy this particular game directly through steam be the only way to ensure that the game you be buy be not tamper with and you would get exactly what be advertise before the actual sale . not like with amazon 's physical copy of `` augmented edition '' pc version of this game , where they be advertise of have a `` bonus code '' for `` tactical pack '' , but do not actually include any of such code -lrb- read up the product discussion board for this particular version of the game -rrb- , or like with gamestop 's physical copy of this game , which be tamper with by gamestop -lrb- google it , the gamestop have officially admit that they intentionally remove a certain `` bonus code '' from the box of this game before reseal the box and sell they as `` new '' to all the customer -rrb- . because of such issue , this -lrb- hopefully -rrb- will be the last game i 'll ever purchase in physical form , all of my future game will be purchase through digital distribution service , be it either steam , ea 's origin or something else . as for the game itself , so far i like it -lrb- and i really , really love the original deus ex and absolutely hate the sequel and other game that attempt the emulate the same experience\/gameplay type -rrb- . i would say it be still not as immersing as the original `` deus ex '' , but it be a very faithful reproduction of it -lrb- the best one so far -rrb- when it come to write storyline , environment design , sound design and other various gameplay element -lrb- such as inventory system , the hud , the weapon system , the `` alternative level progression path '' and so on -rrb- and a very `` polish '' -lrb- in term of the game 's stability\/performance\/bugs issue -rrb- overall product . exclude the issue with the `` bonus code '' i would say it be well worth its price . for people who also like this game , especially for its storyline\/settings , i would also recommend read the related fiction book , `` deus ex : icarus effect '' , which storyline happen in the same `` universe '' , start a little bit earlier in timeline than this game and involve different `` main character '' , though also include the one that you 'll see\/meet in this game -lrb- for example all of the mercenary character that participate in the initial attack on sarif industries lab -rrb- .

693	Video_Games	POS	5	if you be to take the best aspect of the fallout series and throw in some element from the baldur 's gate series and then combine they to form this excellent rpg adventure . from the get go every decision you make will alter the path of the game . from choose a male elf or a female human you decision effect the outcome of the game . the first overwhelming aspect of the game be the leveling system . unlike game such as diablo , arcanum have a vast array of stats , skill , technology , and magick to distribute ability point to . try to stay balance among all of the available option will result in a very difficult game . however if you specialize in a certain skill , technology , or magick you will have a stronger character . the combat engine be a very unique one that adjust to you play style . if you be use to hack and slash rpg 's you might enjoy the real-time combat . however if you use to fallout or baldur 's gate turn base approach you can choose the turn base mode . there be even a cross between the two call fast turn base mode which speed up the turn base movement a bit . in any case there be a mode for everyone . another large part of this game be the development of you character . through conversation and you action you will develop a reputation . in addition if you focus you talent on magick or technology certain people will treat you differently . the entire land of arcanum be divide between magick and technology . choose a focus be the most difficult task . throughout the game you will have the ability to meet other character that will join you on you quest if you leadership ability be high enough and you request they assistance . when you gain control of these npc 's they act as real people . each one have its own personality and objective . they all can be upset by you action and sometime might even decide to attack you and the rest of you party . some npc 's be good some be evil . base on you character alignment you will get along better with some than other . however , this be half the fun . on the negative side you will find several bug , most of which should be fix with the release of the new patch . on a unfortunate note the multiplayer be design to be play on what use to be won.net . be won.net have officially close shop and be currently be run by a minimal staff large lag time and several bug a present here . most people be hope for a addition of tcp\/ip to the network setting allow player to play on gamespy or kali . on another note the biggest flaw in this game release be the manual . it be completely unorganized and will provide little to any assistance . there be no table of contents or glossary and to find the information you want you will have to a. read it from cover to cover . b. visit a arcanum web site . or c. buy the strategy guide . it be unfortunate that a game so fun and well think out would place its manual on its lowest priority . all in all this game be a very exciting and unique game that will be a sure fire nominee for game of the year . if you be a fan of baldur 's gate and fallout 1 & 2 this just may be the game for you . i do however suggest that when purchase the game you also purchase the strategy guide . it be very well write and contain a complete guide to all of the character and weapon you will run across .

810	Video_Games	POS	5	to be perfectly honest , i do not own the action replay , though i would like to . i be only review to let the uninformed buyer know that they should ignore the two people who give the action replay a bad review . this ` christina swan ' person i can forgive , as she apparently do not know much about game system . i 'll tell you now , a cheat system can not ruin the game system itself . i own a gameshark for the n64 , and i know that the dumbest thing you can do with one of those be to put in a bunch of random character and hope it be a good code , and even then , the worst you could do be ruin the gameshark itself . if you want my opinion , the kid probably leave the gamecube open too long , let dust or something get on the laser reader , block the laser and render the gamecube unable to read disc . that happen to i before , the guy who do the repair say that happen a lot with laser-disk base game system like gamecube and ps2 .  as for the i hate action replay guy , i be gonna have to come up with a list for you :  - the code be a bunch of number and letter , it take you over two hour to put in one code .  \* these code be mean to actually change how the gamecube read the game , so you can keep the health meter stick on full and stuff like that . can you appreciate how much programming code be use to pull off something like that ? feel lucky you only have to put in a few letter and number . and as for the two hour , can you say exaggeration !?! i really doubt it would take even the slowest gamer that long to put in code . besides , learn to put a little effort into what you do .  - code only give you stuff like infinite life and extra character , who in they right mind would want that junk on they game ?  \* oh , for the love of ... it be a cheat system . you be suppose to \* gasp \* cheat with it !! who in they right mind would want that on they game , you ask ? everyone but you , apparently .  - the price be too much ... it should be less .  \* it be worth how much it cost the company to make it , plus some for profit . if you do not like it , do not whine to everyone on amazon about it .  - also it do not work on my super nintendo .  \* oh my ... i be sorry , i do not know you have mental problem . you see , kid , a system that be make for a gamecube usually work on a gamecube , not the super nintendo . they be completely different system , you see .  - datel can not make cheat system , they should jump off a bridge .  \* i hate to stoop to you level , but here go : consider you argument , i think the world would be do a much better favor if you be to jump off a bridge . a high one . that happen to be over a pile of jagged rock .  actully , that feel pretty good . anyway , last one :  - do not buy this ... instead go by the amazing etch-a-sketch .  \* why ? if a person be look for a cheat system , how would a toy draw pad help they ? and , no offence to you etch-a-sketch fan , but i do not see what be so amazing about it . please come up with a decent argument next time .  if anyone want to argue about this some more , feel free to e-mail or something , especially if you happen to be anything like this i hate action replay guy . i be here 'til thursday . ; - -rrb-

979	Video_Games	POS	5	this be my favorite game in recent memory . when super mario galaxy be first release , i be skeptical about purchase it . i love super mario 64 but i think super mario sunshine be familiar and gimmicky so i have priorly assume that there be not any gas leave in the mario franchise tank . boy be i wrong . to summarize the game , it be at its core a collection of puzzle . the completion of each puzzle award you with star . collect enough star , and you win the game . it sound mundane , but complete each individual puzzle and collect the star have the charm of , say , complete a sudoku puzzle or the daily crossword . but unlike do consecutive sudoku puzzle , the quest to earn each star in mario galaxy be so fantastically diverse and mind-bendingly innovative , you 'll have a hard time put you controller down . it stem from the absolutely brilliant and imaginative way the designer use the gravity mechanic in the game - the direction of gravity be constantly change , mario will be flip upside down , and you 'll have a wonderful time manipulate the game . i should address another issue that give i pause before i buy the game . i have fear from the trailer and preview that either the game would merely involve jump from tiny planet to tiny planet , kill one or two enemy on each one and collect a few coin ; or that the space setting would quickly grow tiresome -lrb- like the sun-shiny setting of sunshine before it -rrb- . fear not - true some level involve blast from small space object to small space object . but there be tremendous diversity from planet jump puzzle -lrb- which be much more fun than i have anticipate -rrb- to large sprawl landscape to explore much like in super mario 64 . further , travel the different planet give mario the opportunity to visit diversely theme planet - such as you standard green grass setting to fire , ice , desert , water , volcano , etc. setting . so in conclusion , if you be skeptical like i about galaxy , let i assure you it be well worth try out .

221	Video_Games	POS	5	video gaming be one of my favorite activity to do in the lazy time of the day . i be a console stud by heart and have a deep love for the console game . it be for that very reason i be very skeptical work with a video game that only work via a mouse and keyboard . worst of all there be just so many people daily who seem to spam the hell out of other like i say '' get use to it , it be way better ! '' and while this could be consider with game that require keyboard and mouse use such as final fantasy\/etc when it come to game like first person shooter , you learn to grow a deep hate for the w , s , a , and d key . not to mention in the heat of the matter who want to reach halfway across they keyboard to tap r to reload , or hit u to talk , or n to switch weapon ?! i be a shooter by heart and game like team fortress 2 , leave 4 dead , borderlands and call of duty it take much more than just skill master a keyboard . you break you finger on the pad and lose a lot of esteem work that way if you be not into it . it be why that when i have recieve this controller for say game i be in heaven . i have spend week attempt to master the game and even as i have grow use to they the fact have remain i be not a pc gamer . with the mad catz xbox controller i feel like i have the control again and the edge . most of all i have a one up factor over even the console controller : a smoother compact feel , a more sensitive grip , and full access control map to give i the comfort on which button i feel better with . i will say i be deeply skeptical over get a controller for the pc just as much as play on it . for all i know i be get a piece of junk and that worried i . i be glad to say i have it all wrong and in the end i now have another new console to work with that will provide i another full year of entertainment . : -rrb- a few thing i should mention however about the controller that be not specify be that this be not a exact replica of the 360 's version . this be design to be more compact and the control to remain tighter as a group . the layout be design , in my opinion at the very least , more forward for quicker response and certain button be redesign larger for use of ease such as the left and right bumper . the biggest thing i should mention be the leave and right trigger which be make in a hook like mannor that when tap feel so much greater than the 360 version . the bonus side to all of this be that it do not just stop on the pc though . this controller can also work on you very console provide the same awesome control . a word of advice however to user who be play team fortress 2 : in order to gain the full function of you controller you must enter you option menu , go under the keyboard section , go into advanced option and click '' enable developer console '' upon return to the menu press the wave key '' ` '' and then enter on the command `` exec 360controller '' without the '' '' at which point you controller will auto tune to the original control feature on the 360 . for all other game the control easily adjust and can be tune . : -rrb-

15	Video_Games	POS	5	who say the d do not have great game ? liar , that be who ! and with d mario kart you can say you have get one of the best title to hit the d ! and with nintendo d now with wi-fi connection , you can play online and enjoy the fun with up to seven other player ! mario kart d , like all the other , feature grand prix race for you to race in . most of they will not be availible until you complete other race , but that be the fun of mario kart . the race be not too hard , and they be a load of fun ! four of these track be brand new , but several be take from previous mario kart title . from the snes , to the gba release just a couple of year ago . you can enter cup at 50cc , 100cc , or 150cc . this , of course , be the difficulty level . you 'll not only notice you opponent get faster , but they 'll get more aggressive as well . there be eight character with two vehcile each . well , at first . as you progress through the game you 'll unlock more . when decide on a character you of course be look at speed , acceleration , etc. but you may also want to look at thing like ... the drift ... or they item attribute . a low item attribute will often net you item that be pretty much useless . this be not just a rehash of a old game , though . i note that there be four new track , and that it actually combine earlier title . but there be also new powerup in this one . you now have a bullet bill power up which will increase you speed -lrb- and send you temporarily into auto-pilot -rrb- . you 'll also be able to fire off a bob-omb -lrb- that 'll really mess you opponent up -rrb- and you can now release a blooper -lrb- those squid guy -rrb- to squirt ink on the screen of you opponent . these new edition be worth it . in addition to the new power up and track , you have also get `` mission '' mode . this will pit you into course where you 'll have to perform certain task to move on . for example , you may need to pass through gate in a certain order . there be six group with nine level each . each group end with a boss . now let 's move on to the best stuff . the reason a lot of we still play mario kart game . the battle ! you can do the balloon battle and shine runner in a single player mode , but not do they on multi-player would be a sin . mario kart d take complete and total advantage of nintendo 's wi-fus usage . so challenge some people ! get on the wi-fi have great oppurtunity . you can have up to 36 rival , and you can challenge people all over the world . the problem of course , be you could lose the connection . there be little problem with the wi-fi connection , though , and it be much more fun than it appear to be . as you might have guess , the game look and sound great ! it be smooth , like the visual of the n64 version , only smoother -- not as blocky . the sound be great and so be the sound effect . and because the d in stereo , you 'll love it with all you heart . mario kart d be another must own d title . it be not just some port of a old game , it throw in a ton of new stuff . so do not think of pass this up by say , `` i have get it on n64 ! '' the n64 version have nothing on this . so grab it ! the good : + fun stuff to unlock ! + great graphics + great sound ! + you can play multiplayer with a single pack ! + fully take advantage of nintedno wi-fi + not just a rehash of super mario kart 64 , it be actually it be own title ! the bad - you friend and family will certainly feel neglect -- unless they have this game !

772	Video_Games	POS	5	the xbox 360 be arguably one of the most popular console of recent memory , with even hollywood film and television series make reference to `` the xbox '' or show play the console in some manner . the console 's main advantage over its predecessor be the ergonomically design controller . whereas the original xbox feature a rather large controller similar to that of the sega dreamcast , the xbox 360 feature a much smaller , yet larger than the ps3 , design that incorporate easy to use trigger and concave thumbstick which provide better overall grip than the ps3 's analog stick do . however , one thing have always be a little `` off '' about the controller . despite its overall design be praise left and right by consumer and gaming professional alike , one drawback have be constantly present whenever one discuss the xbox 360 controller and that be its directional pad . the playstation controller have always provide one of the best fitting , and most useful , d-pad on a controller to date . however , microsoft go the route of the sega genesis , and utilize more a disc design for they d-pad . the result : a awkward design that do not respond as intend . press `` up '' can sometimes be interpret by the controller as a `` up-forward '' make on screen avatar move in the wrong direction . this controller promise to try to alleviate the problem , and it work , to a degree . the controller provide a much easier to press directional pad which allow the user to ensure that he\/she be indeed press the desire direction properly . it do not move as fluidly as the ps3 d-pad do , but when compare to the previous iteration of the xbox 360 controller , it do provide a much better overall response for each direction . if the user decide to play the game with the traditional disc that the 360 use , a simple twist of the d-pad convert it back it to its regular form . overall , the controller provide a better directional pad than previous version of the controller , with slightly improved response from the four major direction : up , leave , right , and down . however , if a user be expect ps3 level responsiveness , than they may be disappoint . the color scheme be a nice touch to the controller , provide a overall classy , and sleek design .

905	Video_Games	POS	4	turtle beach deliver a excellent gaming experience with the ear force x41 digital wireless headphone . i take off a single star for a few con to be discuss , but , overall , the package live up to expectation . though these headphone obviously will not blow away audiophile , they offer enough clarity and separation to hear the entire range of action , from bgm to voice . it also offer a decent 10m range , so it work perfect in a basic entertainment setup . the base also send the digitally process signal through the analog out , a nice bonus . there be a few `` however `` s to point out . the sound be fairly plush , but it be weak on high and low . the headphone will not blow anybody away with bass , and the high be easily distort . the 10m range also mean you might have to play around with you setup . mine be fine for now , but i 'll have to move thing around to position the base just right . if you get beyond the ` happy ' communication range , you will notice some nasty hissing and pop . if something interrupt the signal , you will notice hissing and pop . also important to note , battery pay a huge roll in maintain quality of audio reception . if you use poor\/low-quality battery or allow the battery to run low , the frequency of the hiss and occurrence of pop increase . my biggest complaint be the include optical cable . it be cheap , far too flexible , and about as thin as uncooked spaghetti . you will want to buy a better quality optical cable . you want a optical cable with some flexibility , but it need to be stiff enough to protect the delicate glass tube . if the glass break , you can kiss the signal goodbye . also , audio pass through for the win ! turtle beach understand that gamer sometimes want to enjoy a game with friend and\/or family without disturbing everybody around they . with the pass through , anybody playing along side you get to enjoy the x41 's digital processing without any fuss . also , you can hook up some analog wireless headphone if you , say , want to pull up you preferred music player and listen from 30m \* away . \* 30m range for analog wireless headphone base on average 900mhz

how can you lose with basically unlimited health ? bioware have finally fix this issue in the gameplay . play on hard on the ps3 da2 version i continuously get party wipe at certain encounter in kirkwall due to overwhelming force -lrb- enemy spawn in wave -rrb- and the inability to plan tactically with the controller and limited interface . the cooldown on potion have ramp up the difficulty quite a bit . bioware indicate that hard on da2 = normal on origin . nothing can be further from the truth . multiple wave of enemy plus potion and heal spell cooldown make fight extremely tactical and difficult . on the pc , it be a bit easier due to the ability to micromanage you party . this bring i to the next issue with the console version , it be almost impossible to play tactical without a good overhead mode . the mouse and keyboard on the pc be far easier to click through you battle plan while the better overhead view allow you see farther out . unfortunately the camera be always lock on you select character . this be a fail on bioware . they need to release the camera and let it go free . nevertheless , with the more tactical view and keyboard and mouse , hard mode be quite a bit easier on the pc than the console . on the pc i manage to keep all three of my character at the intial level survive the first ogre battle without a single death and only one health and one mana potion use , but ion the console , i usually win with only my mage run in circle and the rest of the party wipe . hit a to attack on the console be actually pretty fun . i can not imagine play use auto attack with the controller -lrb- which btw be not implement in the release , it may need to be patch for this -rrb- . unfortunately , hard mode be overly difficulty for button masher . i would not want to play the console version in anything higher than normal . story \*\*\* -lrb- so far , will update -rrb- so far , i like the initial story more than origin . my favorite back-story from origin be the human noble . it have element of tragedy and revenge which help in give you a reason go forward with the story . i can finish a bad game with a great story -lrb- mafia 2 -rrb- but i simply can not finish a good game with a bad story . gameplay-wise , most game get repetitive after about 20 hour . without a good story to push you forward , then you be simply go through the motion . so far the game lack a strong central antagonist . i be not talk about a nameless evil like the first game . good story tell require a compelling protagonist , antagonist , and pathos . 12 hour in , it be miss the antagonist portion . the darkspawn be too generic and it be over after one year . the fact that you sibling get kill by a random darkspawn , well , bioware miss a good opportunity here . you just kill he murderer ... and then the blight be over quickly . so what be the point of the game ? gaining fame and fortune , rag to riches have less appeal than a good revenge story . a scheming , backstabbing , machiavellian baron be a far better antagonist than a boring nameless evil enemy that you only get to see for the first time at the end of the game . . then you promptly kill he . however , i will give this story a chance to surprise i . interface \*\*\*\* they have streamlined the interface quite a bit . the inventory be manageable . you know which item be trash so you can just sell it without wonder what it be . this be a huge improvement over the craptastic origin inventory . everything else be good except for the limited armor for you companion . look , bioware , if you want the outfit to stay the same for each character , that be fine . however , let we find loot that upgrade it . for example , how about a fabric slot , a gauntlet slot , a boot slot , and a armor slot that be upgradeable but do not overly change the way the armor look ? right now , you can only purchase slight upgrade from merchant which upgrade it 4 time over the course of the game . automatic upgrade via level be lame , lame , lame . not be able to equip armor for npc 's be especially lame since inventory management be half the fun of rpg 's . for some npc 's , the weapon be also lock as well . for example , i find a bow that be much better than bianca -lrb- 72 damage vs 49 -rrb- but i could not equip it on varric because he only use bianca . what ? if npc 's be go to have they own weapon , at least have it level to a comparable level to find loot ! damage number and status condition can be turn on in the option . i highly recommend this be the first thing turn on when you get the game . i be glad this be still available . the rest of the interface be just too minimalist . i think this be due to the memory footprint for console . luckily for pc 's , modding will -lrb- hopefully -rrb- take care of this . graphics \*\*\* the character be all model very well . however , the background lack the polygon . this be most likely due to the weaker console capability . the pc version get the shaft on this . on the plus side , if you have a middling pc , then this game will likely work well for you . and it work on the very long in the tooth xbox and ps3 console . the graphic be serviceable and i be not too hang up on it . what matter be it be fun . there be always the witcher 2 for the graphic department . gameplay \*\*\*\*\* this be where da2 really shine . i think one of the weakest element of origin be in the tactical combat element of the game , namely it be not difficult at all once you level up or the game break ability of certain class . like mass effect , origin be completely unbalanced . that game start off difficult but then progressively get easier due to the enemy not be able to keep up with you character . the mage in the original game if specc correctly would become near invincible by end game . you absolutely do not require tactic to beat the game , even on nightmare -lrb- ok , maybe i be exaggerate a bit -rrb- . oh yeah , do i mention no cooldown on potion which make the challenge moot ?

'' if the warrior die , you party will most likely fall as well . for da2 , bioware have add cross class combo . each class have a certain status induce attack that the other two can exploit . this be a very cool new feature but unfortunately only higher level character can exploit . stagger , brittle , etc. be impossible to perform with lower level ability . final verdict \*\*\*\*\* for pc , \*\*\*\* for console -lrb- may change once i finish the game -rrb- for those who compare the combat in this game to diablo , nothing can be further from the truth . this be truly a tactical party rpg , more similar to baldur 's gate on the higher difficulty level than origin . for those who consider this game as the mass effect-ification of dragon age , you be partly right . the streamlining of the story , party member and interface be very similar to mass effect . however , the combat absolutely do not get the mass effect treatment . the party combat in mass effect 1\/2 be a joke . you be basically a one man army in mass effect 1 and 2 with party member as side show and ornament than real . it be possible to play mass effect as a single person shooter by disregard party member altogether . that be not true at all in dragon age 2 . if you do not understand the art of tanking and crowd control , on hard or higher you will party wipe . it sound like i be be overly critical yet give it a five star anyway . the reason be that the ultimate judge of game be do i enjoy the game ? yes , it be the most enjoyable game i play since dragon age origins . i much prefer this game over both origin and mass effect 2 due to its overhaul combat system . this game on the pc be closer to a 5 than a 4 . for the console version , something be miss -- namely the precise control for tactical combat . if you be consider this game , i recommend the pc version if you can run it . otherwise , the console version be a fine game as well , minus one star . update : add class balance

215	Video_Games	POS	5	mass effect 3 improve upon the combat of the second game slightly , the graphic of the second game , and drastically improve up weapon selection and customization . combat be get closer and closer to other expert 3rd person shoot like uncharted and gears of war but still do not feel quite as good . the story and voice acting be top notch although if you playing just the 3rd game and not import a character you miss out on ton of option . you constantly force into the worst possible situation with path selection that would have be avoid if you have build relationship with ally in the previous game . you wont even notice the difference unless you watch someone who have a import character . the previous game help in huge unexpected way with most of the game situation and make ton of minus bonus to remind you of everything you have ever do . so its a great game by itself and as a 3rd part of the trilogy its a amazing game . multiplayer be similar to killzones multiplayer with random objective poppp up as you play though . although you only fighting wave of ai enemy with a group of 4 there be no player verse player multiplayer . you have to capture point , download datum , survive wave , assassinate target , make it to evacuation point the whole time fight wave of random spawning soldier from select enemy type from the main game . you then use money earn for each kill to buy pack that contain random item , alien races\/classes to play as , or weapons\/weapon mod . it be very well do and a requirement for the best outcome in single player . play improve the performance of you troops in single player and be the only way to get a strong enough force for the absolute best end although it may be possible with a import character with every quest do i do not know for sure . i do have to mention performance problem on the ps3 version . some movie sequence be choppy on the ps3 but for the most part the gameplay will be pretty close to constant 30 fp until you in intense fight . some level later on do run a little poor with some room run slightly slower constantly even with no fight kinda remind i of how the ps3 version of crysis 2 be . this be a huge step up over the original mass effect performance so if you have play the whole series on console you can still look back and laugh at how bad it use to be . end good but do not explain the aftermath good enough . but free dlc that further explain the situation for the galaxy have be announce so there be not much to complain about there .

590	Video_Games	POS	5	first off let i tell you that this be the best game ever to come out on any console . if anyone doubt i just read this review . the graphic in my book be amazing i would give they a 10\/10 the gameplay10\/10 and the overall score since the scale dose not reach 10 10\/10 . slick collio and any one who doubt this game be so wrong because this game be so perfect that it should actualy recieve a 20\/10 . if any one would say the ending be dumb do not pay any attention to the cut screen in the game so you do not get the end . if you ask i the end be clever and to the point . whoever say that gta san andreas be better do not pay any attention to the tree in the backround of the big smoke mission . if you pay any attention you would see that the tree grow in less than1 second . now back to the topic halo 2 . i get the special edition one . even though it cost $ 5 more it come with a bonus dvd that show the making of halo 2 and it also show the early stage before halo 1 be in first person view . i buy this game the day it come out because i reserve it at the mall near my house . if you ask i this should have make game of the year and those of you who be mad that it do not know that it just miss the deadline to be qualify for game of th year . for those gta fan out there you should be glad that it miss the deadline because it would have kick its @ $ $ in the pole . to end my review for you die hard halo fan we will have we day when rockstar run out of idea on what to base the city on in later gta game and they might accidently base it on new york again and we will laugh in there face when they do .

885	Video_Games	POS	4	what i love be the cover system . it be on par with uncharted . and i love that the cover point be often destructible . kind of a challenge . also cover be of all size , and some be less effective than other . if it be a 2 foot tall curb , you will literally lay flat on the ground to get under it . the slide suit ! bravo ! god that be fun . truly something i have never see before . hell fun zoom around the level . the game be a little short but you can play it over and over , cuz there be a million way to pass a level . the few downside be 1 there be no on-line mode . 1 player only . i think it be a good start for this franchise . and i be glad they do not try to force the on-line mode into the first version , because the gameplay be pretty incredible . i can see how it would be hard to do a multiplayer mode . but for the sequel they should disable `` bullet time '' and let the player zoom around the map . also ... give we a \* jump \* . please . i get so frustrated with game that do not have a jump function . sure you can kind of do a quick double tap to cover , and then climb over a obstacle , but it be not the same as be to jump from say one raise platform to another . it take you out of the fantasy , when you want to do something very intuitive , and then realize the limitation of the simulation . the fact that you sometimes get stick around a 3 foot tall obstacle be kind of the only problem with this game . in term of cover base 3rd person shooter , uncharted be still king . no question . but this definitely have potential . i give it a strong 8.5 \/ 10

795	Video_Games	POS	4	both ea sports active and more workouts be great for give you a lot of potential workout and keep you motivate . i have find the 60 day challenge workout for the more workouts version be more challenging than the 30 day challenge workout for the original . i also love that they add a warm up and cool down to each . my favorite cardio routine on the original be the step cardio boxing and the dancing . on the newer version , the squash be a blast . i keep want to do it over and over to see how far i can get without miss the ball . i also like some of the obstacle course workout and the run now have a view vs. just a track as in the original . here be some of the thing i wish they have do differently : be able to combine workout in both version to create the custom workout allow `` replacement '' workout in the challenge -lrb- i wish this be in the first as well -rrb- . for example , i have trouble with some of the high impact move due to joint\/back problem and large natural breast that bounce even with a good bra -lrb- i.e. the skip -lrb- jump rope -rrb- and stride jump -rrb- i wish they would allow you to choose a alternate workout in the challenge vs. just delete it so you still keep the same time , calorie , etc. . this be my biggest complaint . finally , it be annoy that they keep repeat the `` watch i '' in the warm up exercise . once you have do it once , that should go away just like the video in the regular workout . overall , both workout be a great value for the money and more workout just build on the great start from ea sports active . the controller recognition\/response seem better as well .

93	Video_Games	POS	4	i think this game 's strongpoint may be the multiplayer play but the single player campaign be just better-than-average . i be not into the multiplayer thing so it would have be better if i buy this one use . it be a good , fun , game but i be hope for something epic , like halo or gears of war level epic . the second to the last level , the jackal mission , be very cool with non-stop action in every direction ... i think as i play that level `` yeah ! here we go , this game be rock now ! '' 3 or 4 more intense level like that and i would have give the game a 5-star rating but the game end on the next level which be not too difficult after you be give the bfg . also , it seem like the game give you a lot of weapon that you have little to no use for . i could pretty much get through the whole game with the combat shotgun , sniper rifle , and machinegun without any trouble . and once you have the ability to make pop rocket round for the shotgun i could obliterate anything on a level with that gun alone . wingsticks , crossbow , assault rifle , pistol , grenade , you do not really need they if you have enough ammo for the other gun . albeit , all of this be on the normal level . i will give the game a go on hard difficulty and it will hopefully it will require more utilization of the other weapon . this game really do have the bethesda touch to it . if you have play fallout you will know what i mean . i kind of do not like some of they method for story-telling because it get tedious and feel overly-formatted . like this ... walk up to character , talk to character , accept quest , perform quest , return to character , receive reward . the option screen that allow you to accept or decline a quest be pointless ... you always accept the quest and can complete it or not , too decline it be just dumb . that stupid option screen lend to the formulaic feel of the game quest and it would be much better off without it .

524	Video_Games	POS	4	there be no reason to state the amount of hype attach to this game , so i be not go to . let i say i have hardly ever see a game that live up to its hype completely . many of the greatest game be sequel in a already polish series . the third and final installment of halo -lrb- or so bungie say -rrb- encompass everything the game developer be look to add to the second one . and in my opinion , they execute this very well . here be a short mach up of the game 's main part : gameplay 9 of 10 : the mechanic feel very good and a lot of the game resemble halo : combat evolved . everything be intuitive , no drastic change but many small beneficial addition . many of the serious physics problem from halo 2 be address . i will say it be my favorite of the three in term of pure gameplay . there be constant action and variation . the arbiter be take out of the gameplay for the most part . many people complain about end halo 2 as the arbiter . now , only as a cooperative partner can the arbiter join in . my favorite feature of the game be a great deal of the enemy have change . to begin with the flood be only in two complete level if i remember correctly . nobody i know like fight they . the developer take this to heart . a few thing i have notice about they : if you shoot the flood part of the `` infected '' they go down easier , they be now able to be beat into they constituent and they be just quite simply not as difficult to kill . in fact the difficulty level be a step down from the first two game . normal seem like a enhance easy . brute be considerably weaker . a few shot to the chest now destroy they armor . skull however , make the game more like the legendary setting of old . there be 13 skull that can be find in various secret place in the game . they add thing like : grunt throw many more grenade , all enemy have extra health , you have to hit enemy to get shield back etc. . four of the skull allow you to change you armor on xbox live . these also add multiplier to the meta-game . in the meta-game you be give point base on how and who you kill . brute obviously net more point . this be a fun way to compete with other via xbox live . so many feature have be add to this game , it be hard to list they all . graphic 8 of 10 : very good visual stand out even from other next generation game . lighting and reflection be greatly superior to many other current game , weapon look more realistic than anything in the game . much more time be spend on the texture and close up visual . color be vibrant , everything have sharp and crisp line as long as you have hd or i prefer s-video -lrb- because i be lame and have a crt -rrb- . if you do not , halo 3 will resemble a enhance halo 2 visually . controls 8 of 10 : controls take a evolutionary step , with only a couple of button move out of necessity for the special item . the basics be the same as first and second game and as always have little to no learning curve for a person familiar with fp . there be more option on the personalization of the control now . in my opinion halo 3 have the best control for a shooter game and have be copy before . music \/ sound effect 7 of 10 : the music be just brilliantly do , now with a full orchestra . and the original soundtrack have be considerably enhance and expand by martin o'donnell and michael salvatori -lrb- the composer for all three game -rrb- . with a orchestra in the background , the game just feel more epic and give a human quality to the story . the sound effect on the other hand be nothing new or really better than ok , even with the volume way up it be hard to get the full experience . many of the weapon seem to be tone down literally . weapons 8 of 10 : many , many weapon be add . here be a full list : http:\/\/halo.wikia.com\/wiki\/weapons there be probably more weapon in this game than the first two combine . unfortunately , many go by the wayside because of there ineffectiveness against enemies-especially on multiplayer . if you remember those large energy shield you always see the covenant standing behind and always wish you own , halo 3 give you the option to do so along with a bunch of other new special item : energy drain , deployable cover , trip mine , bubble shield , flare , invincibility , incendiary grenade and a few more . the bubble shield be quite impressive-throw this out and a large sphere will encapsulate you and keep out any and all weapon fire include explosive . however , anyone can walk in . vehicles 8 of 10 : a very well do fleet of both human , covenant and brute vehicle , quite a few new vehicle on every side along with mostly improve version of the old one . there be multiple version of the warthog . the mongoose -- be a small non-armored atv capable of very fast speed . a new bunch of brute vehicle such as the chopper enter the fray . and if you have not guess , the scarab be back . in fact you 'll get to destroy four within the game . phantom be now destroyable . the tank now house a separate gunner for the machine gun while some speed be add and even out the slower rate of fire . a full list of the vehicle : http:\/\/halo.wikia.com\/wiki\/vehicles story 6 of 10 : i must say my view on the plot surround halo 3 be blurry . i have play through the game a few time now and can not understand where it be go . it seem to be overly complex without explain much . the story center on the master chief lose cortana . about halfway through i really lose interest in what be go on with gravemind and the flood and say forget it . maybe a primer should have come with the game or it do and i fail to read it . honestly , if someone can give i a synopsis of the storyline i would really appreciate it . unfortunately the halo book have not progress thus far and i 'll have to wait to find out just exactly how the game end . multiplayer 6 of 10 : and now for the thing that make halo famous . multiplayer have to be separate into two distinct part : the gameplay and the matchmaking system . let 's discuss the bad first . quite obviously the matchmaking system ... which can be livable at best . in the past the worst part about matchmaking be the wait time , constant restart and even complete loss of game because people quit or lose they connection . in retrospect they be not that bad compare to the most recent addition to the game . in fact get into a match be now very fast -lrb- about 2 minute on average -rrb- however , bungie feel it be necessary to now change fundamental part of multiplayer . just last weekend i notice that something be seriously off . while attack a person i take his\/her shield down and meleed only to find it would not kill him\/her . i be also get kill by thing that should not have kill i . plasma grenade would explode 5-10 foot away-killing i . it be not the case before . this be not a singular phenomenon . my friend notice the same problem . nothing be consistent anymore . also supposedly less than 50,000 people be online . if you have not play before these thing might not bother you . to i it seem as if the programming be now favor the weaker player . it be kind of like study for a history exam and then somebody hand you a math test instead and take it away halfway through the allotted time . i have really lose interest in the game since this occur . aside from that there be ton of map and a decent amount of game variant . new map pack come out about every 3-4 month for a price . as be the case , they be make free month after they have come out . i be not sure what to think about multiplayer now . there be not superior multiplayer infrastructure in term of scope for xbox live . but at the same time when you be not sure what the physical rule be , how can i feel anything but disillusioned . conclusion a very well think out and truly fun game-which be something lack in these next gen game . `` over-realism '' be not fun . videogame be mean provide a escape . halo have this in spade . a genetically enhance super soldier that fight alien in a half ton cybernetic suit of armor-brilliant . and you get to play as he . overall this game be the best halo for you money . if you own a xbox 360 i would not think twice about purchase this .
564	Video_Games	POS	5	this update to the d be a significant one due to the online support not the graphic . i know that it have be advertise as amazing 3d which it do have but i feel that the street pass and spot pass feature be truely amazing along with the pedometer it be interesting to know that there be people out there with it and the street plaza find mii game be really fun . the marketplace be great the next step be have full game for download and we will probably see that in the next update to the handheld system . one con : the battery be absulutely terrible ! it last about 5 hour a little less with 3d on and high brightness , you dont need to have these option on but even if you put power saver on and brightness on 1 , the most it will last on standby be about a day and a half with occational gameplay . overall : great game console . kid love it and they get to share more thing with they friend .

81	Video_Games	POS	4	double dash be a fun racing game , but like its predecessor , it do not really innovate much or last that long , but its still pretty good . graphic be great and framerate be a solid 60 fp . sound be pretty good , and the game can offer a challenge . do not get this game if you plan to play alone . it be no fun . get it only if you have someone to play with on a regular basis . it be a solid racing title overall , and consider that the gc do not really have a lot of they , it be a lot more appealing . but wait for it to go down to $ 20 before purchase . also try f-zero if you want a lot of speed .
899	Video_Games	POS	5	before i play this game i play smt : nocturne . i be impress with the game mechanic , as well as delighted with the difficulty of the game -lrb- unlike ff game , it be possible to be wipe out by even low level monster if you be not careful -rrb- . so , when i see another game sport the smt engine be come to the ps2 i reserve it immediately . frankly i find this game to be better than smt : n in most respects . true you do not get to create a `` army '' of monster as in smt : n -lrb- probably one of the better feature of smt : n -rrb- , but you do have a greater control of the growth of you character than you do in smt : n -lrb- you no longer loose forever the skill that you replace -rrb- . so here be a breakdown of the game : plot : 4\/5 very good plot , somewhat confusing , but most of we who play japanese game and read mangas be use to be keep in the dark about what be really go on -lrb- as well as spending much of the earlier moment confuse as hell ... big-o be a great example of this -rrb- . much like xenosaga , there be a lot of information available that can be use to help figure thing out , but you have to pay attention and be ready to think a little outside the box . the only thing i dislike be the use of the `` silent protagonist '' . i hate this technique with a passion , where the main character be only give choice every once and a while , and in the meantime do not say a single word . some of you may be familiar with this technique , as it be be use in a lot of game , such as chrono trigger -lrb- and cross as well -rrb- , smt : n , the breath of fire game , and a couple of the suikoden game -lrb- the first one for sure -rrb- . the reason i dislike this technique ? it cause the main character to be flat , shallow , and pretty much iconic . basically , it prevent a lot of possible character development for who should be the focus of the plot . but with the silent protagonist character , you can only learn about the main character through other , and the other be of course allow to reach a depth the main character can not obtain . in smt : dd the main character `` serph '' be the allow only to reach a state that i would call `` robotic . '' there be a couple of moment where he be portray as have more depth , but those be flee and overall you be leave with a character who seem to lack a personality . this aside , the other character be develop fairly well , with enough left unknown to merit the sequel . graphic : 3\/5 good . this be make stright up use the smt engine from nocturne . they even keep most of the demon from nocturne . the background and dungeon be somewhat drab , but that be do intentionally because of the setting in which the game take place . the only negative side to the graphic be that sometimes the resolution be somewhat low , which can lead to problem with position . sound : 5\/5 excellent . this be one of the few success in voice act i have see in a dub video game recently . while the voice acting be not the best in the world , it at least portray the character well , and the line be not give with a constant tone of wooden indifference . there be a couple of voice that do not quite hit the mark , but the core cast be very well do . the music be excellent , many of the tune fit the atmosphere , and the introduction reel by etero anime fit the intro scene . control : 5\/5 great . the control be almost exactly as they be in smt : n. the battle system use the same attack number determination as well . most control be straight forward , although the battle system be more complex for those use to ff turn base style combat . but if you pay attention and read up on the combat , it become second nature after a while . novelty : 2\/5 below average . this be the one low point of the game . it be unfortunate that they choose to keep so many of the monster from smt : n. it make the game feel more like a mod than a actual self enclose game . by keep so much of the smt : n system they pretty much lose all ability to consider the game a novel creation . although dd be a great game , if you have play nocturne , you 'll find yourself say `` hey wait a minute i have see this before '' quite a bit . the plot be quite original , as be many of the item and some new skill . but for the most part , it feel like you be play a game with 40 % new material and 60 % recycled material . overall : 5\/5 it be a great game despite a few flaw . if you like smt : n then you 'll love this game . if you hate smt : n or find it frustratingly difficult , then you 'll find this game much the same .
423	Video_Games	POS	4	this be a good game , but i have a few reccomendation and i have find a few flaw . here be a list of they . mr. clanky - it be cool that you unlock he after you win the backyard world series but you can ` t put he on you normal team , in fact you can only use he in a single game ! player - they be basicly good but they skill rating be a little off on a few of they , for instance a person who the game say be great at batting , like barry bonds can really be pretty bad at it . trading - i haven ` t get far but i be pretty confident that there be not and will not be a trading option , and i think that it would be cool if you could trade with other player or the computer . skill - it would be nice if you player skill rating increase with the experience they get from game . graphic - the graphic be ok but not anything special . i think this be a good game and that be why i give it four star , so i can ` t wait to get the upcome version .
336	Video_Games	POS	4	i really love this game , but it feel too much like # 2 , they really do not improve a whole lot and the story be very similar . i think i actually like # 2 more so . i would say get it if you love the series , but do not be too impressed .

697	Video_Games	POS	4	story-i enjoy the story , much like ff12 with the corrupted government genre . the only drawback be the cieth , which i feel be write into the plot as a last minute explanation for hunts . as with a regular jrpg , part of the story be heavily soak in melodrama and might make american gamer cringe . the ending be a `` eh ... ok '' sort of feeling but tie up loose end . voice acting-great voice act , the voice suit the character nicely , yes even vanille . a upbeat cheerful character get a upbeat cheerful voice . the character from pulse get a english accent be a nice subtle touch too . graphics\/sound-stunning environment and in-game cut scene , even the menu screen be sleek and futuristic-looking . quality expect from the playstation system as well as past ff game . gameplay-those who want to finish every mission and pick up every item will find themselves play for a long while . the main plot be relatively short , as square expect you to continue play past the end credit , unlike past ff game which do not let you save . possibly the most addictive part of this game be the battle system as long as you do not keep mash auto-battle . frankly the auto-battle feel like a cheap blow to my pride when i first see it . last thoughts-obviously this ff13 be gear to bring in those who have never play ff game before . usually know for they storyline , 13 's be only decent . graphic be excellent , but only to be expect from the ff franchise . i would wait for the price to drop before pick this up and save my money for versus .
363	Video_Games	POS	4	first off . yes you get a tutorial . the first hour or so be completely on training wheel , and after that hour you get introduce to new mechanic as they come up , complete with context pop up . tired of the abrupt manticore fight and dragon movie everytime you start a new character ? too bad . want to just skip all of it and start at the first riftstone ? too bad . already know how to issue command ? too bad , they be get explain again ? why ? tutorial ! every review i have read cries\/praises the lack of a turorial as if this game be somehow the deep end of the pool . sorry , it be there and the learning curve be not all that scary . this be not demon 's soul . challenge level in combat feel about right for i . i be not get amalur carpal tunnel , nor be i boring my way through final fantasy autocombat . there be not a lot of micromanage in combat , so unless you have some tandem move , the ai be go to take and keep control of you minion . you can configure you minion ai to a extent , though not on the fly . also , since it isnt list anywhere - you can change the vocation of you main character and main pawn , and change back to any unlock vocation with no lose progress . -lrb- if i max out my main pawn as a fighter , then change he to a wizard , he 'll go right back to be a max out fighter should i change he back -rrb- . the pawn mechanic be definately what set the game apart . you 'll learn new tactic from visit pawn , and you main pawn will benefit while in other people game . since visit pawn dont level up with you , you 'll need to continually shop around for the ` perfect ' pawn to accompany you . you can rate a pawn and gift the owner on the release of one , and it be do in a pretty complimentary manner . if you lack a internet connection , there be already a large number of pawn ingame for recruiting . the graphic be pretty solid , voice acting be ok . the story be not this big gripping epic , it be a backdrop to start you off and to eventually finish you with . everything that come between be standard wow quest fare . there be no real multiplayer to speak of , but you 'll need a internet connection to access the pawn create by other player , and the group effort fight like the ur-dragon . the camera like to hide you . . not nearly as much as amalur , but it be there . the quest\/map interface be a little clunky , but still serviceable . it also autoformat into widescreen , so you may be stick with formatting bar .

372	Video_Games	POS	4	madden be one of those series that continue to be very good . there be some new feature in this game that be not in the 05 version . first be the qb vision . basically , during you pass , you quarterback can not see the whole field leave to right so the qb vision be a cone type device that show where you qb be look . for more veteran type qb 's the cone to see be bigger , while rookie and the not so good qb it be smaller . you want to throw it in where you qb be look or else there could be a bad pass . this idea be pretty good because it can let the qb get finer throw and throw the defense off . however , if you be use it , rookie quarterback like alex smith be much harder to use it with and end up in a lot of incomplete pass . there be a new superstar mode where you take a create player and try to make he a superstar in the nfl . you get you own mentor like terrell davis and you choose a agent and you lead you superstar into the spotlight . they partcipate in a iq test and interview to determine you rating . then you play the game and try to make you player a superstar . after a while of play this , it get boring , so i just stick with francise mode . other thing update be the different type of tackle , new commentary -lrb- thankfully ea cut down on the madden talk , where he would talk forever about a simple play -rrb- , different kick meter -lrb- i think this be better than the previous one -rrb- , more talk from tony bruno , and different storyline for the newspaper . also gameplay have dramically be improve . in the 05 version you would see the opponent runner always get stop by you defense no matter how bad they be . now the defens play how the attribute of the player be . for example san francisco can not stop the run while baltimore can . couple of bad thing be the controller configuration . if you want to change what a button do on a run play , you have to change the same button for what it do on recieve , and on defense which be annoying . also some of the image look the same from the 05 game . personally , i love this game better than the 05 version . if you be a hardcore football gamer , you need this , if you just want to try it or you own 05 version , i would get the 05 because it basically the same game except a couple of different feature not really important to gameplay .

148	Video_Games	POS	4	great game for shooter fan best of the series period !!!! resistance 3 be fun fill ride excellent weapon and the weapon wheel be back make this the best in the trilogy by far . i love resistance 1 and like r2 mainly the co-op that be offer with r2 so really wish that c0-op be include with resistance 3 . hopefully they will do like red dead redemption do and make co-op a dlc later on in the near future . this game have a great and well pace campaign very fun and have some memorable shootout and a very bleak and desperate atmosphere which be the right mood for this game . every gaming magazine and website have be rating resistance 3 close to 9 's out of 10 and 4.5 out of 5 except for game informer they be the only outlet that give it a 7.5 for have some bug that i never notice and such a bleak atmosphere which really do not make sense to lower the score that much for it be purposely bleak setting and tone . i wish insomniac would have also do alot more with they extended development time some may want to rent it first but if you a fan of shooter and a fan of resistance then go ahead and purchase it you will not be disappoint . multiplayer-now multiplayer be a fun and crazy time weapon be always be upgrade so be you character which help alot and headshot matter alot in this game . the only thing lack be the co-op mode from resistance 2 it do have a campaign co-op which also very fun to enjoy with friend and split screen co-op also . when and if this game get it be old co-op style back then it will be the alot better there be occasional glitch not as much as be reprt by gi but nothing game breaking . i also wish the old big team battle be back they be a blast on the sequel but i guess since humanity be all but wipe out battle have to be more like small skirmish .

785	Video_Games	POS	4	i have be play spore on a friend 's computer -lrb- my laptop be not old by a long shot , but i do not think it could handle it -rrb- and just reach the tribal phase after hour of play . many reviewer have suggest that the first two stage of the game be much too short , and i agree that the cell phase be -lrb- they could have make that more in-depth , even have another aquatic creature phase in between -rrb- , but i think the land-based creature phase be sufficiently long . it take awhile to explore all my option and i be sure i miss plenty of detail . surprising thing happen like volcano erupt and ufo come to abduct the poor primitive species of my planet -lrb- amusing look into the future when i can do that ! -rrb- . spore do not have quite the same sense of humor -lrb- at least not yet -rrb- as the sims , but it certainly have element of it . little quirk and detail can result in some really funny thing happen if you take time to notice . i love take time to really make elaborate and unique modification to my creature . if you be not in the mood to be creative , it do not really affect the effectiveness of you animal . you can modify it for look , or just quickly stick on the change you want and go . even at the cellular stage , there be room to be distinctive . my friend make a little amoeba that look quite different from mine even with what seem like limited option . and once on dry land , the variety be freakish and astonishing . i never see another life form that even remotely resemble mine in the least of way . this be a colorful , cheerful , goofy game . i think that be a good thing . i believe it could have be more complex\/slightly less childlike , but i be not hugely disappointed . lovely appearance and really fun to personalize . but i do think it take a certain type of personality to really enjoy spore to its full extent . those who say this be not a replayable game or be only amusing for a few hour ... no offense , but i think it indicate a certain lack of imagination . which be fine , it be just that this be not the sort of game for you . if you could play by yourself with doll or action figure for hour as a kid , come up with endless story and scenario , build environment and prop for they ... spore be probably you kind of thing . i understand concern regard the drm , but most of the review bash it state that the reviewer refuse to buy the game on account of it . if you have not play the game , how can you review it ? it be certainly valid to protest it and make you opinion know , but that do not constitute a critique of the game 's content . it be as if j.k. rowling decide to donate all the proceeds from harry potter to a organization you hate on moral principle , so you write a amazon review of she last book say the book be terrible without have read it . yes , you be refuse to buy it for a good reason , but you can not actually have anything worthwhile to say about the plot of the book itself . violently beat down the star rating of a product because of the politics surround it be childish and obsessive . i disregard out of hand any review which `` review '' without have play .

136	Video_Games	POS	5	>> the premise dissidia duodecim , for the uninitiated , be a 3-d , real-time brawler feature most of the main protagonist and antagonist of the entire final fantasy series . battle be frenetic , acrobatic , and -- while seemingly shallow at first -- offer deep strategy and customization . it be a lot like  super smash bros.  what this mean be that , just like smash bros. , dissidia provide ton of secret , unlockable , fan service , and content . player unfamiliar with final fantasy will get considerably less mileage out of dissidia than fan of even one game in the series , but there be still a solid brawler in here with serious rpg trappings . >> the gameplay brawl play out in a similar manner : prowl around you enemy and use the circle button to nail they with bravery attack , which do not do damage , but increase you bravery meter . the higher you bravery meter , the more damage you 'll deal when you finally hit the square button and unleash a hp attack . the point , ultimately , be to whittle away you opponent 's hp , use a mix of bravery and hp attack , until they be defeat . mix in with this be a lot of dodge , roll , fly around , block , explosion , and magic . battle earn you exp , which in turn level you up , which in turn allow you learn new bravery and hp attack . this be where the rpg foundation of final fantasy come into play , allow you to equip new move , item , summons , and accessory in a attempt to give you the upper hand while duke it out . >> the verdict dissidia duodecim bring enough new content to the table that return fan should definitely take a look , even if they have pour hundred of hour into the first game . folk who have play even one game in the final fantasy series and be curious about this title should definitely give it a spin . if you like the first dissidia , you 'll love this sequel -- it be bigger , better , quicker , and deeper than the first . if you never like the first dissidia , however , this one will not convert you . fan of brawler should also take a look , even if they be unfamiliar with final fantasy . dissidia duodecim be a standout title on the psp , and offer a huge amount of bang for the buck . >> what be new \* character : lightning , kain , tifa , yuna , laguna , vaan , and a few other all come to the roster with new fight style that be fun and unique . so far , i have play heavily as lightning , tifa , and yuna , and they new style fit right in to dissidia perfectly . \* stage : a handful of new stage have be introduce to coincide with the addition to the character roster . orphan 's cradle from ffxiii look and play great , and there be several other new stage that provide a welcome change in environment . for now , though , it only seem like there be 3 or 4 new stage . \* move : return character have a few new trick up they sleeve to mix thing up . \* music : new tune have be add -- not only for game like ffxiius and ffxius , which be not represent it the first dissidia , but it also seem as if at least one new song have be include from all the previous game as well . menu bgm have be remix slightly . the music , both new and old , sound wonderful . \* assists : pick you character , then pick any other character on the roster to be you assist buddy when you need help . assist character can be assign in the customization screen , similar to how accessory , equipment , and summons be assign . you can fight without assist character , but it be worth it to have one along for some flashy help during a brawl . there be bravery assist and hp assist , and both should be use judiciously : although it be easy to fill up the assist meter , it be also easy to use a assist at the wrong time and waste a opportunity . each character offer a different skillset for assist , so it be important to consider you own fighting style and bring along the right assist character in order to maximize you strategy . \* story mode : much improve over the original , the story mode in dissidia duodecim now offer a expansive overworld to explore in between the familiar , grid-based battle level from the first game . there be lot of secret , treasure chest , wander foe , and moogle shop in the overworld , make it a awesome addition to this sequel . cutscene be do better , and the new scenario feature all six of the new character be great . \* party free battle : create team of up to five character to take into tournament-style or round robin battle . assign a class to each character to receive stat bonus , then unlock temporary new class that be more powerful as you progress through each battle . \* creation mode : this mode be truly the highlight of the game for i -- i be very impress by it . creation mode allow you to create you own quest scenario , include static cutscene and custom fight , which you can then share with friend . you can also save , edit , and watch replay in this mode , which offer a surprisingly robust theater mode similar to  halo 3  pause the replay , move the camera around , take screenshot , cut and string together the video , and then convert you masterpiece to a . avus that can be upload to you computer ! awesome ! i have spend hour play around in this mode , and expect to spend many hour more . \* gameplay tweak : the aus seem tougher in battle mode , but battle feel much more responsive and smooth . unlockable item and equipment seem to come along much more frequently after every battle compare to the first game , which make fight more rewarding . assist add a great new layer of strategy to battle . >> what be familiar \* character : all the familiar face from the first dissidium reprise they role and fight style here . \* stage : all the stage from the first game be available in this sequel as well . \* music : all the music of the first game make a welcome return \* gameplay : the core gameplay remain unchanged . aside from the addition of assist , brawl be still very similar to the first dissidia , though more responsive . level up be still the same , and the customization screen with the cute little chocobo be the same as in the first game . do not fix what be not break , right ? >> pro : + gameplay feel a little tighter and more responsive than in the first game . + graphics seem a little better . + new character , stage , and music be great addition to the game . + new cutscene in story mode seem as if they be a little better write , better act , and better direct than in the first . + the overworld in story mode be awesome , and fairly large . + the ability to import you save from the first dissidia mean any old character you level up will retain they skill and level in this game . you can also choose to import you save without bring over the level you have accrue . + creation mode be a stunning and excellent new mode for those who like to make they own movie , screenshot , and quest . + the ability to save replay as . avus file that can be upload to a computer -lrb- and play from you psp 's video folder -rrb- be a truly awesome feature . -lrb- be sure to turn on replay in the options mode , first . -rrb- + assist be a great addition to battle . + the datum install feature help cut load time -lrb- install the maximum of 814 mb cut load time by about 75 % -- but it take about 2 hour to install -rrb- . the install size include 492mb , 574mb , and 814mb . + the game be overwhelmingly deep , and offer a huge amount of content for a great price -- even for those who spend ton of hour in the first dissidia . + battlegen item be much easier to create in duodecim . >> con : - load time seem to be a few seconds longer in this game than in the first . even with a maximum datum install , load take just a second or three longer here than after install datum in the first game . the wait be noticeable compare to the first game , but certainly not terrible . - it be still easy to get stick in cheap juggle move by the computer , but assist help alleviate this issue by let you assist character take the hit for you , if need . - still no infrastructure mode . with the ability to create custom quest and edit replay , it be too bad there be no online portal to share you creation . you can still battle and share with friend use ad-hoc mode , but a true online mode would certainly have be welcome . >> thing to note : \*  dissidium 012 -lrb- duodecim -rrb- final fantasy  if you be look to get a dissidia game , get this one , not the first , because duodecim include all the stuff from the first game , plus a ton more .

542	Video_Games	POS	5	i think human revolution be a strong buy if you be look for something outside of the call of duty-style shooting gallery . dxhr be a place of character , decision and consequence , as much as it be a place of bullet and bloodshed . it be one of the more rewarding action game that i have play in several year and a worthy companion to the original . the story be a engrossing techno-thriller potboiler , where you be never quite sure who you can trust , or for how long . some alliance be brief , and turn of fate can come unexpectedly . thing be not what they appear to be at first , and people be not always who they seem to be . the more you uncover , the higher the stake seem to get . but you do get clue about where thing be go to go , if you hack enough computer and get you hand on the right people and the right document . even the side mission inform you about the game world and how you character be view by other ; sometimes a hero-in-waiting , other time a potential contract killer . it be up to you to confirm they belief or prove they wrong . after all , you have great potential for both good and evil with you `` augmentation , '' prosthetic that re not just mechanical assistance but machinery \* better \* than flesh and graft to you body ; replace lung , eye , and heart , not to mention you limb . the higher capacity that this give a person -- and the effect that it have on the perception of they very humanity -- will be a run theme throughout the game . dhxr also hearken back to the old splinter cell , with a side of metal gear solid . like those game , you can not run into a room gun blaze . you have to strategize by either pick people off surgically , or avoid they altogether . you 'll need to get password and keycode to get into secret area , and the environment be highly explorable -- there be a distinct lack of paint door and arbitrary obstacle , and a complete absence of invisible wall . so go ahead and wander down that corridor that lead away from you objective , because you may find a useful weapon or valuable piece of information . the area have a variety of alternate route , some of which you need special ability -lrb- call `` augmentation '' -rrb- to access . you 'll need to hide the people you have take down , because another person sight they can set off a alarm . if the person you have take down be unconscious -lrb- you get a variety of non-lethal approach to combat -rrb- , then they can be revive . firefight use a cover-based system that put you in a third-person , over-the-shoulder perspective . you can blind-fire or aim around corner . and you can lob a variety of grenade . you can hack robotic gun turret sometimes and turn they against you attacker . it work pretty smoothly without make you feel like the game be do all the cover work for you . as far as production value go , the visual be behind the curve , but this do mean that more computer will be able to handle the game without many performance issue . the voice acting be generally very good , although adam jensen may be a acquire taste . it help i to pretend he be basically clint eastwood transport to the future . the ambient music be incredibly atmospheric , although the main theme be use heavily , and you may find it repetitive . sound effect be also polish and vary . if i have any complaint , it would be for the spike in difficulty for the `` boss battle . '' there be few of they , thankfully , but you 'll probably find yourself reload many time before you finally crack it . it be not ninja gaiden maddening , but it do evoke the same kind of frustration . there be also a lot of back-and-forth when wander in between mission , without really any landmark to guide you . it be a bit easy to get lose or hit a dead-end .

104	Video_Games	POS	5	rarely do a video game controller come into the scene and actually stand out . over the year controller design have matter as much as the game themselves - i mean , it be how you control the game anyway , right ? handle the most basic layout of the ne to the often-ridiculed n64 pitchfork controller , gamer have play for hour and hour with these device learn the feel of the controller until they become like a extension of they finger . designer will shape and reshape controller until they have find something that do not stand in the way of you and the game , and this time , i think they nail it : the 2010 xbox 360 wireless silver special edition . the first thing that jump at you be the color -lrb- or lack thereof -rrb- : silver . it look like steel , not black or white plastic , which automatically make it appear classier . the button be no longer yellow , blue , green and red , but instead replace with a grayscale . a glossy black band wrap the edge of the controller along with the shoulder and trigger button , make the face of the unit pop out visually . the lack of any grommet on the raise portion of the face where the two analog stick and d-pad emerge make it look even more like stainless steel , and give it a impenetrable feel . the weight be heavier than the original model , which make the rumble and shake more explosive . the size and layout remain the same , which be perfect to begin with - microsoft do not fix what be not break . what wa break on the original , however , be the directional pad . it feel like the designer leave that part until the very end of the design and then be rush to get a finish product , so the one-piece disc that become the d-pad suffer in look and functionality . with that be say , here come the best part of the re-vamped version . the d-pad on the 2010 silver model be a completely new design for all controller . it be actually two piece and it have two mode : recess and pronounce . the recess mode highly resemble the feel of the original d-pad while maintain the responsiveness -lrb- which , by the way , be astounding -rrb- of the new model . my favorite mode though be its pronounced mode , which you get by actually twist the cross on the d-pad and rotate it clockwise . by do this , the circular edge of the d-pad drop down inside the controller opening make the cross pop out , give you better control of up , down , leave and right without accidentally move in the corner of those direction and get something totally different in-game than you be go for . any game that require moderate use of the d-pad will play better with this control feature . it be also chromed-out just like the dashboard button , which just look badass . the thumbstick also feel better , with slightly less resistance which make for smoother movement , and the little nub on the thumb be go . the start and select button be darker and gloss over just like the y , b , x , and a button , and as mention earlier the shoulder and trigger button be slick in glossy black . one of my favorite finishing touch on this controller be the engrave on the top of the controller . set inside the glossy black band , you would have to look twice to catch that it do not say `` microsoft '' anymore , but rather the much more hip `` xbox 360 '' . everyone know what company make xbox , so we do not need to see such a brand stamp on the controller that suck we back into reality before we even play the game . i would rather see my controller brand with a 360 logo , because it stand for what you be currently do : play video game , as oppose to the word `` microsoft '' which be most associate with computer and tech like that . when i hear the company name i think about reality , but when i hear the product name i think about fun game . it be a simple but incredibly strong improvement . the fact that this controller come bundle with a rechargeable battery and a charge cable all for the price of a new game make it a deal that any xbox 360 lover can not pass up . if you do not believe i , take a look at the photo in this album . it be the james bond of video game controller .

72	Video_Games	POS	5	i write a review about this game previously , but i still do not understand why people try to insult the id software programmer . first thing i want to mention be that people can choose to dislike the game , i can respect that , because different people have different opinion since this be a free country ... brother & sister ... but i do not respect people who be call the game be `` stupid '' or `` waste of money '' etc. ... without a reason and understand the game 's true plot , those comment be not respect the id programmer or the gamer community that respect id software for many year , people really need to try to think about how to provide invaluable feedback . i know people be always compare rtcw with medal of honor or some other game out in the market , but if you think carefully , id 's previous title be always about shoot and kill and complete objective and it have be that way for many year ... but rtcw be load with a whole new story that deal with twisted science create by the axis during wwii , be just like the movie `` indiana jones-the lose ark ... & the last crusade '' , something that involve with freaky stuff and twisted science ... . . maybe i be such a old timer to bring out movie like that ... . . and medal of honor 's objective be to `` win the war '' . as i say earlier in my previous review , both game have different plot . well anyway ... its a disappointment for rtcw 's fan to hear that id decide not to release the expansion pack for rtcw call `` enemy territory '' , they have say the other game developer -lrb- business partner -rrb- in england can not meet the deadline where they be busy with serveral project in they hand , and the title will never be out on the market with a tight schedule like that , but they have mention the multiplayer map for `` enemy territory '' be downloadable as a freeware in they official website . . hmmm . . something to play with while you be wait . i be just like the other id fan ... look forward to see that they can wrap up the title in the near future .

23	Video_Games	POS	5	you have probably see how revolutionary super mario 64 be on the nintendo 64 . well , imagine if the game be separate into minus planet , and you see mario soar through the air as he be launch into the air . that , my friend , be mario galaxy . the game start out with mario roam through a gorgeously detailed mushroom kingdom as he run to peach 's castle ... for cake . but then , guess what ? not only do bowser kidnap peach again . he kidnap peach in a very epic cutscene ! unfortunately for mario , a magikoopa send he fly into the galaxy , knock he out . now , the main game be play through very big and graphical 3d world bounce on goombas , collect coin , and all kind of other stuff . but , like super mario 64 , you must collect stars . collect enough stars to be able to play in another world , or maybe have mario tussle with bowser . if you be to play the game , you 'll notice that everything , and i mean everything , be much , much deeper and more fun than i be describe it . the music be nothing like i have ever hear in a mario game . i mean , seriously . once i play the game until after i beat the first bowser boss , i be think `` oh , my god . these track be from a mario game ?? '' . the music also breathe air into the spacey atmosphere in the game . the one major complaint i have with this game be that the 2-player mode be stupid . there be almost nothing the second player can do to help the first player play through the game . sure , he\/she can collect star bits , launch they at enemy , and fling those ... rubber . . tree at enemy . but that be pretty much it . the second player do not even have his\/her own character -lrb- thanks , mario galaxy 2 -rrb- . but other than the 2-player mode , the game be amazing . it be one of the best wii game you can buy . oh , and spoiler alert : luigi be playable after you collect all 121 stars , in case you do not know .
432	Video_Games	POS	4	halo 3 be just release . bungie should have pay closer attention to gears of war . first of all , let i get out of the way that i never play online multiplayer , so i can not comment on that aspect and it be totally unimportant to i in game . as to the game itself , i find it to be a shallow storyline , with a weak , undeveloped plot , that be highly linear -lrb- you do not get any choice about how to approach thing -rrb- and would have be predictable if there have be enough exposition for there to be anything to predict . but what it do well , it do really , really well , which be totally intense no-holds-barred action . 1 . the graphic , which be not terribly bright or colorful , be still fantastic . all movie do not have to be shoot in bright daylight in easily-viewed scene . nor do all game . most of this game occur under cloudy sky or underground . nothing wrong with that . in fact , it make the game more gloomy and give it a nicely-darkened feeling that impact the emotion of the game . that say , the texture , the art , be all great . the building , people , bad guy , weapon , and especially the explosion and mayhem -lrb- and i mean that literally -rrb- be very well do . it be very intense . a lot be make of graphic and people sometimes rightfully point out that the graphic do not make a great game . that be true . but good graphic can add ton of positive atmospherics to a game and really immerse a player and i think this game do as good of a job at that as any i have play . 2 . the sound be also brilliant . i love the whistle bullet , scream bad guy , etc. . what i do not like be all the gratuitous swearing . look , i be sure to the target audience 16-year old high school hooligan , swearing about evil bad guy be , like , totally awesome , or whatever kid say these day . for the rest of we , it be stupid because it mean we have to turn the volume down in we house with we wife or kid around , and it make a video game unnecessarily crass . one occassional , whisper `` oh my god '' can be a thousand time more impactful than a dozen `` s % ! t my weapon jam ! '' over and over again . anyway , just a personal thing but i wish these game company would get away from the cussing . sound otherwise be great . 3 . the gameplay be the best thing about it , though . the cover system be highly intuitive ; you run up against something and press a button and boom , the character model mold to the cover , and then can move around near it and fire over or around it , etc. . the cover system be also useful in how it jumpstart move throughout the environment -lrb- such as switching from one piece of cover to another -rrb- . running be do by hold down a button , you can not fire while run as you put you head down and just go , but it look very cool and realistic . 4 . the game be short , but other people seem to be better at it than i since it take i twice as long as some other people . i think it take i a solid 18 hour , but i regularly read about people say they beat it in 6 hour . i must just suck at these game . anyway , still feel short to i . 5 . the plot be weak not because it be not a cool plot , but because there be some gaping hole that do not make any sense . for example , why be the main character in prison ? how do that effect anything else during the game at all ? why be it interesting that he return to the family demens later on ? why do that matter ? -lrb- answer , it do not , because nothing be ever make of it in the game -rrb- . what be that mapping thing ? what be the sonar weapon ? i think these game , and it be not unique to gears , need a very solid backstory\/comic\/short novel to be sell with the game that describe all this stuff -- perhaps to be read as you progress through the game ? because the cut scene be cool but they just leave too many hole . overall , a fine game . very thrilling and fun and intense . the weakly-explained plot detract from a five star to make it a four .
135	Video_Games	POS	5	hello i be 17 year old and have be play game for a loooong time . so do not discard i just yet ! i own a game cube and a ps2 . to be honest i teach like most people out there , `` that a game cube be for little kid '' . but like most people have see the game cube be not for little kid . just take a look at this game ... hitman 2 , true crime : streets of la , resident evil , mortal kombat : deadly alliance , dead to rights , def jam vendetta , and many more tittle . i teach that the ps2 be better and it never accure to i that i would buy a game cube . i get it with super smash bros. . melee and freekstyle . it be great , i be play for a long time and i just get soo in to it that i do not even see the time fly by .  i like how small it be and everyone that have see it like it because of its small size , small disc , and great look . but i still get that `` be not the ps2 better ? '' . well if you think that pay more for a console be `` better '' than go for it and waste you money on that cheap dvd add-in . i know that the line `` include dvd '' sound awesome and i feel for it too like many other out there . but start think about it and it be not that great . plus if you already have one -lrb- which most of we do -rrb- why would you need one ? first of the ps2 do not support mp3 's , vcd 's , svcd 's , the zoom feature , different angle feature , record dvd 's feature , and it do not have progressive scan . a must have for better dvd quality . and with the price of dvd player now a day i think its better to go out there and buy the dvd player separate . this also mean not go out there and hunt around for a decent dvd control . get my point ?  ok let continue ! i have the game cube and the playstation 2 , i dont have the xbox and i have not play it either , so to be fair i will not talk about it . so here we go !  game cube - small size , small cd 's , easy to carry , fast set-up , very comfortable controller , very durable , 3 different color , awesome game variety , addictive `` only for '' games , have never freeze , and under $ 100 .  ps2 - some-what small , great button layout , stand vertically -lrb- with help -rrb- and horizontally , play dvd 's , fast set-up , have `` grand theft auto '' , great game variety and do not freeze freakently -lrb- but have about 10 time since i have it \* 6 month \* -rrb- .  so bottom line if you want a awesome system that look great and play even greater , get the game cube . the only reason i would not buy one be if i still think that it be for little kid , or if i do not have a dvd player and need one fast , but like i state on top i do not think you want that one anyway . so hopefully this help you and have guide you to buy what be right for you ! happy gaming ! : -rrb-
158	Video_Games	POS	5	i personally consider this one of the best game i have ever play . the storyline wasnt as good as i expect , it be too rush and i couldnt grasp what be happen . also the gameplay in the in-game game be completely different from the previous two halo game . there be ton more gun , the new addition of equipment , and a very odd life system . no longer be there a shield , only a bar at the top and if that hit 0 you dead . the graphic be simply breathtaking . i be play it and a friend walk in and think i be watch a reality movie . for all you people who say it suck , the trick be too hook it up to a hd-tv , that what its optimize for and when the graphic enter unbelievibly-blow you mind state . the multiplayer be incredible . it be similar to halo 2 , but with the introduce of forge and more map . i play for hour yestarday and never get tire . so even though you may not enjoy the campaign as much as you think , and the graphic may blow you mind temporarily , i give this game a easy 5\/5 .

769	Video_Games	POS	5	this be a very fun and highly detailed game . it be the best flight simulator there be i think . if you know how sofisticated windows 7 be , just think of something as sofisticated as windows xp as a video game and it will let you know how many detail be in this game . you can go from easy , medium , and hard difficulty . hard be basically a real rendition of fly a real plane . easy be pretty much cake in the mission until you get halfway . i just put it on medium and thing like wind and descent rate be make i crash like crazy , and i have be play this game for a couple year now . the funny thing be , i really enjoy fly jet because they be the funnest and easiest thing to fly i think . well next to the ultralight anyway . another funny thing be that the helicopters be extremely hard to fly . i still can not get past the helicopter mission even on easy . it always fly out of control and then crash whenever i try to turn it . maybe it be just i but they be extremely hard to fly . the good thing about this game be free flight . you can fly from one destination to another destination airport . it be pretty fun because you have to stop in town to refuel and stuff , but i still have not figure that out . i enjoy just fly around and then crash into a lake or something . it be cool to see the different scene . i once fly from like washington to alaska and you can tell the different state because alaska have a lot of tree and snow and stuff . overall , this game be really fun and enjoyable to everyone i think over the age of something like 10 . forget all those black op game and stuff like that just poison the mind , pick this game up , you will not regret it . i have the deluxe version , but if i be you i would pick up the gold edition with the acceleration pack . i think it have a few more mission which be great and a couple more airplane . i wish they would just create a flight simulator xi already because this game be get pretty date with the graphic . i be sure they can create way better graphic and maybe different mission . but for now , this game be fantastic !

410	Video_Games	POS	4	i own a wii and a xbox 360 . i be come to the realization that the reason why i have these two console be not just because i want the exclusively licensed game content for each -lrb- such as zelda on the wii or halo on the xbox -rrb- , but it be become more and more apparent to i that the xbox be my single-player console , and the wii be my multiplayer console . i tend to play immersive first-person single player game that take advantage of the hd graphic and audio power of the xbox 360 , while the wii be generally use to play multiplayer game , especially when we have friend over . this game will not disappoint on that front . the action be frantic and hilarious . the microgame consist of dozen -lrb- nintendo claim around 200 in total -rrb- of different task center around a number of `` form '' or start position . for instance , the first form you will encounter be the remote control , and you hold the wiimote just like you be hold the tv 's remote control . from this position you might be task with accomplish anything from toss some stir-fry in a saute pan to flip pancake , or shooting can or even bounce a tennis ball on a racquet . there be form like `` the handlebars '' where you hold the wiimote crosswise with both hand , or `` the diner '' where you hook up the nunchuk attachment and hold the two controller like a fork and knife . pretty much every microgame be time to last just a few seconds so you have to think - and act ! - quickly . the more you play , the better you 'll recognize the challenge , but that do not mean they be easy ! each type of microgame generally have at least three level of difficulty , and in addition to get harder you 'll typically find that either you have less time as you get farther into a series of challenge . the single-player game be really just about introduce the various form and unlock different activity , culminate in unlock the multiplayer game . you should be able to complete the single-player portion in a hour or two to unlock multiplayer mode . multiplayer mode offer additional game -lrb- two to start , and play through each one unlock another game , which unlock another , for a total of 7 or 8 multiplayer style that accommodate anywhere from 2-12 player , depend on the game . this be where what i see as the first real shortcoming of smooth move come in ... you can only use one wiimote at a time . it seem pointless to force player to pass the wiimote back and forth -lrb- especially since the action be usually happen fairly quickly , and nintendo insist that you must wear the wrist safety strap , which can make it sometimes difficult to get ready in time for you turn -rrb- . allow the use of up to 4 wiimote would be much preferable . if you be not into the multiplayer experience , then you will definitely want to pass on this game . it be a fun game to run through , but after a few hour you would be bore out of you mind . this be primarily a party-oriented game for 2-4 player -lrb- though as i say , some game allow for up to as many as 12 player take turn -rrb- . it be kind of like the popular card game uno . . not so much fun for two people , and much better with four - the more people you get play the more fun it be for everyone . a lot of the game cause you to do crazy thing that everyone will be laugh about so it be not a lot of just sit around , wait for you turn .

937	Video_Games	POS	5	so i be tire of switching cable composite\/component cable at the back of my ps3 to alternately switch between a older , sony crt vega tv -lrb- which still have a spectacular picture btw -rrb- and to a projection system use a component cable ... so i order this universal cable to avoid swap connector at the ps3 . why would anyone do such a thing ? simple , i be not always in the mood for a giant gaming experience and it avoid use precious projector bulb life 'cause they be not cheap . the cable work perfectly for this purpose on the ps3 . both composite and component connection be route in the cable and both work with the selector switch on hdtv -lrb- ps3 in ntsc mode -rrb- . to define the ultimate in laziness , i no longer have to leave the couch to switch between the two ... it be just a menu setting change on the ps3 . all route pass through my av receiver so i do not even have to change the input selection on the receiver . i could route component signal to the tv as well but i would have to have a buffered video signal box to split the receiver 's component output while not degrade the signal to the projector . not to mention the tv be natively only ntsc resolution anyway even though it do have a component input -lrb- a complete waste -rrb- . i could go into greater detail about video format but seem like overkill just talk about a cable . since the universal cable be also suppose to work with the wii , i think i would plug that in too . user should take caution when attempt to turn on two device at the same time and potentially just plug they in at the same time as all the connection be route together in the cable which could lead to a video\/audio output try to drive another video\/audio output . probably will not hurt anything except there will not be a picture or sound . i quickly discover , however , that the composite signal for the wii with the selector on hdtv do not output anything on composite . i would guess that the wii console need to detect a pin on the cable to switch video mode ... can not run both output at the same time but be that really important for most user ? : -rrb- i do not test the cable with a 360 but i will say i be impressed that the 360 connector appear to have the optical audio converter build in like the microsoft brand component cable . i see that at the time of write the m component cable for 360 cost a little less than this universal cable . chance be it be the same as the wii in that the console need to detect a pin on the cable to switch video mode so the component\/composite can not be use simultaneously . basically , cable work exactly as i be hope for my ps3 : -rrb-
196	Video_Games	POS	5	well , we buy this for we two son 's . one have xbox and the other have playstation3 . my ps3 son who be 25 say and i quote : `` it be dope and bad a$ $ '' i be guess this mean he like it a lot . my xbox son who be 23 say : `` this game be awesome '' now , my wii husband who be 55 want one . they love the fact that you can play as the cop . so i guess that pretty much sum it up .

532	Video_Games	POS	4	graphics -------- graphically , super mario galaxy be not as detail as some other title -lrb-  the legend of zelda : twilight princess  the answer to that question be a resounding yes . many game be inconsistent between movie cutscene and gameplay , but this mario title never miss a beat . there be lot of bold solid color , minimal shading , minimal anti-aliasing , and almost no shadow or lighting effect . this be deliberate , and evoke the feel of the original mario title -lrb- and so i be tell the mario 64 title , which i have never play -rrb- . this lack of detail conveniently also allow the game to work nearly flawlessly on the wii with almost no frame rate issue -lrb- the exception be at least one of the underwater sequence - water be hard to animate -rrb- . it do tend to look a little jagged at time on larger screen because of the wii 's limited output resolution , but it be a acceptable sacrifice . overall , i give it a 4\/5 star for graphic . i suspect that future title will find way around the wii 's graphical limitation , and we 'll see better-looking game with the same or better performance , but for a relatively early title it look pretty darn good . music \/ sound ------------- this be where galaxy shine . a lot of the music be fully orchestrate , and it blend almost seamlessly with the more electronic musical theme , include all of the old favorite . they have cleverly layered multiple track so that they can switch between they to add or subtract additional orchestration at key moment -lrb- like when you set bowser spin around the planet , the orchestra suddenly chime in much louder -rrb- , and even the sound effect -lrb- with a few exception -rrb- be engineer so that they stay in the same key as the music . this be all design to make the game as immersive as possible , and they pull it off beautifully . -lrb- incidentally , this multi-layered musical approach be also use to great effect in twilight princess . other game manufacturer really ought to pay attention to this and consider use this technique for they own game . -rrb- i give the music and sound easily 5\/5 star . controls -------- the main problem that i have find be that the nunchuk thumb controller be a little hard to steer accurately . also , there be time when you really want to adjust the camera \* just so \* and the game just will not let you do it . this get frustrating when you be force to jump over chasm at awkward angle . part of this be deliberate -lrb- for example , when gravity change , you can not adjust the world to be right-side up and you have to compensate -rrb- , but at other time it just seem like poor implementation . it seem to i that use the wiimote pointer would be the `` right '' way to aim the camera , but instead they force you to use a awkward combination of the d-pad and the nunchuk 's c button . there be a way to temporarily look at you situation in first-person view , but it be rarely useful and frustrating to control . i also have a great deal of trouble control mario underwater , and fly be really quite frustrating . other than that , the control be fairly smooth and responsive . the use of the wiimote pointer to pick up starbit be very efficient , and the z button work pretty well to do long jump and back-flip , although if you be not line up exactly right -lrb- darn camera ! -rrb- you 'll go fly off the edge of a cliff pretty quickly . the 2-player option be surprisingly useful for later level where you be too focus on not die to worry about pick up star bit , so you can have a buddy focus on that and provide you with cover fire . while not the best feature of galaxy , it be a appreciate and useful addition . overall , i give the control 3\/5 star . overall gameplay ---------------- as just about everyone else in the world have point out , the level design be phenomenal . there will be countless moment when you look at a upcoming challenge , ponder it for a moment , and then mutter `` oh ! '' when you figure out what you have to do to overcome it . then , you 'll probably say to yourself , `` how clever ! '' almost every level have a new and totally unique challenge of some sort . the new mario suit , which be require to complete you quest , range from the familiar to the rather bizarre . far from just be power-up , each suit pose its own unique challenge and limitation . each level take roughly 10-15 minute to complete - perfect for a quick break between other activity . i like to do the dish , take a quick mario break , then go fold some laundry , etc. . my only complaint be that if you do save you game and reload , you start back at the observatory and lose all of you extra life . -lrb- grant , free marios be exceptionally easy to come by , so this be more of a quibble , although the first time i see it happen i be a bit take aback . -rrb- for the exceptional creativity , level of challenge , secret level and entertaining sub-plot , i give mario a 5\/5 for sheer entertainment value . replayability -------------_nn for the most part , once you have figure out how to conquer a particular puzzle , you do not really need to tackle it again . therefore , i be not sure how replayable this particular title be , as the detail of the level do not really change much -lrb- once you have gather all of the star from the area -rrb- . i think some of you might enjoy replay past level and try to better you coin total . i do not get much out of that personally . i give it roughly 3\/5 for replayability , meaning , i would not trade the game in after i beat it , but i be not sure i would play it again afterwards . i might consider play through some of the level with a second player around to help out , or perhaps i would be the second player just to see exactly how much i can contribute .
858	Video_Games	POS	5	this be my 4th nd game and i absolutely love it . other 's have complain that the game play be too short but that do not bother i at all , however i buy it as a 4 pack so it end up be about $ 3.50 per game . it be easier than the other 's i have play because i usually have to look up hint on the internet but this one i be able to solve myself which be the best part . i love the story line and really like all of the different area i find to explore . this would actually be a excellent game for someone who be never play a nancy drew mystery before .

547	Video_Games	POS	5	knight of the old republic be a awesome game that be just as compelling to play as the first one . although , there be a few more bug that cause for headache and aggrevation . however , if you be willing to overlook these minor problem , this game will draw you into a world all its own . kotor2 pick up where the first one leave off , you be a jedus outcast that have be abandon on a die ship that harbor on a equally die planet . you sole companion for the beginning be a old jedi woman that have become you bond mate through the force , and a tough , fiesty fighter pilot that be throw in the clink . however , through the course of you journey you will pick up other along the way , some old friend , other ... well , we just be not quite sure . as far as planet and plot go , there be more to choose from and go through , its a very lengthy game to say the least . it take i about four hour just to get off the first planet , and that be play it straight through . also , for those of you that enjoy fps , this game likely will not thrill , for the puzzle come thick and fast , and the plot revolve around alot of communicate with you follower . the graphic be really good , and run pretty decent on the lower system -lrb- mine for example -rrb- and the enviromental element be truly amazing . there be the ability to see you breath on frosty planet , and the wind gently blow tree and grass . its a game that be truly immersive . however , the end be a big disappointment . typical end of kill the boss -lrb- s -rrb- , but then there be just the end movie and the game stop . no final dialogue , and you never do find out what really happen on malachor v , or what happen to you friend that where stick there . obsidion get to carry away by try to live up to bioware 's standard that they forget the most importent aspect of this game , and that the ending really do count . i have to agree with everyone else that this game be rather half-done . its still a great game to play , and a worthy sequel to knight of the old republic , but that end ... .
893	Video_Games	POS	5	i do not know what people be complain about , this be the first time that we see a non `` save the world from the ancient evil '' type story . although i admit that strip away some feature from da : o be a bad idea for bioware , there some clear step forward like intertaction between party member , lack of clear good or evil char and many more be definetly a plus in my book !
190	Video_Games	POS	5	i have play this game many time , and have not be bore yet . i think that , contrary to other 's belief , the drive control be not bad , they be realistic . the gun be fun to use , and the story be amazing . you make lot of friend , and the way you decision influence the story add a very nice sense of realism to the game . and to those say that the main character be boring , or that it suck you can not manage a gang or buy property like in san andreas , consider that the main character be a immigrant . this game have good replay value and be well worth the buy .

646	Video_Games	POS	5	note - i be post my review on both product page of this game since amazon have it list on two separate page . after demo some of the other mystery case files game , and find out that they be search-and-find game , slightly like i spy , i decide that they be not really for i . but after hear that this game have slightly more of a adventure game feel to it , i decide to buy it and give it a go . this be be breakdown of the game : story - you be drive in you car when a snowstorm keep you from go on . you get out to try to find a phone , but instead you find a abandon car with a vhs in it . you watch the vhs and see a terrify girl try to escape something . you set out to find this girl and see if she can help you , but you discover a much more sinister mystery while look for she ... gameplay - the gameplay be so unique in this game , and it be so fun . most of the time , it be a third person adventure game that have you go around solve puzzle , collect item , and use these item to interact with other item . however , there be also search-and-find scene throughout the game that have you find 12 object in a picture -lrb- no time limit -rrb- and keep one of those item to put in you inventory . there be quite a few of these , make the game a great mixture of both style of game . and there be even a few horror element in the game , too , as there be a few pop-out that may startle you , but they probably will not give you nightmare . as a final note , there be also more vhs tape to find and collect throughout the game that help the story move along , and this be a nice part of the gameplay . graphics - the graphic for the most part be really well do . they be kind of a realistic\/cartoon\/3d fusion , which sound really weird , but let i just say that be be awesome to look at . the vhs tape , however , be act out by real people , and this be not really part of graphic , but it be a great part of the game . the video be chill , and the actor act out the story so well ; it be almost like watch a movie . sound - the sound be chill . you might hear a footstep behind you , or a whisper , and they be very good indeed . the music be very enjoyable to listen to . it be tense , sad , and spooky all at the same time . there be not really voice act except for the actor in the vhs tape , and like i say , that be wonderful . fun - this game get addicting more towards the middle , but the beginning be definitely not a disappointment . the fact that it be a combination of hidden object casual gaming and mysterious adventure gaming make it a extremely interesting and fun game . replay factor - there be definitely replay value in this game as the hidden object in this game be constantly change , so each time you play the game again , you have new object to find . the story be interesting enough to play again , as well . overall , this be one of the best game i have ever play due to the fact of the fusion of style that this game have . it be definitely worth a try even if you have not be a fan of the earlier mcf game , and i highly recommend this game .

396	Video_Games	POS	4	i have be die to get my hand on this game for a long time and jump when i see amazon have it . just as i expect its similar to the munchables on the wius . gameplay : when you start the game you be place in a training level that allow you to get use to the control and use the katamari . trust i you 'll need it . it take i awhile to get use to control the katamari and even though i finish the game it still fill a bit akward at time . you move by tilt both anologue stick in the same direction . the anologue stick be gonna be use for just about everything and will take time to get use to . it can get annoying becaise as the katamari get bigger it get harder to control depend on the princes stamen . run into object you can not pick up cause you to loose item . the quick turn will become you best friend for level where there be ton of huge object . another thing that annoy i be when i get big i end up get stick in narrow spot make navigation a b \*\*\*\* expecially in the city level . after awhile i learn how to avoid these problem . it do take time to get use and some level of skill . once use to it the control become pretty simple . story : the story of the game basically go like this . you play as the prince who be send to earth to roll up object in a speare like object call a katamari . you be do this because you father , the king of the cosmos , accidently destroy they all -lrb- the prickxd -rrb- . the big ball of object you pick up will becaome either stardust , a star , or even a constellation . you be give a time limit in just about every level to pick up as many object as you can or as many of a particular object . its pretty straight foward . the level i have the most trouble with , and i be happy there only two of they , be the ursa mijor and tarus level . i hate these level with a passionxd you have to pick up just one of a particular object and more time than none you 'll get a big katamarus and end up pick up a small bull or bear make all you hard work for nothing -rrb- . -lrb- you get the best score if you pick a huge version of the object , but the world be scatter with they of different size . if you pick up one you do not want by accident it automatically end . that be a pain in ass . graphic : the graphic be nothing special , but thier not bad either . everything in the game look like toy . i would not say lego , but some type of toy similar to lego . i actually enjoy check out the scenario . i never play anything that look the way this game look . music : whoever make this game music be evilxd if you play this game prepare to hear these track in you sleep ! i find myself relax and hum to the jazzy tune it play ! i do not know japenese , but it do not stop i from try to sing along to the musicxd length : the game be really , really short . you could finish it within a few hour , but there alot of replayability if you want to find all the present , object , make the biggest star you can , and unlock other thing . there also a two player mode , but i can not say much about it because i currently have noone to play it with -lrb- i be the last child in the housexd -rrb- . it have its flaw , but katamari damacy be a really addicting and fun game once you get into it . thier be even moment where i laugh because there be some amusing object and peaple in the game you collect . the king himself serve as some good comic relief too . i just wish it be longer . its not for hardcore player but its good if you just want to sit back and casually play a game like i . i highly recommend it .

238	Video_Games	POS	5	this review be come from a 32 year old woman who prefer simple side-scroller like mario . i usually do not like rpg 's , but this game have such great review i decide to give it a try . plus there be a limited number of 3d game out there at the time and i want to expand my library . firstly , you should know that this game barely utilize the 3d function of the 3d . it be only use in the opening scene and when you fuse demon . i find this very disappointing at first , but the sheer awesomeness of the game soon make i forget about the 3d . i do not play video game much now that i be a adult and do not have a ton of free time , but this game have i addict ! i have not be this addict since pokemon first come out . the story be fantastic and keep you engage , they teach you the control gradually so it be not too complicate to learn , and the demon auction and fusion keep the ` addictive collector ' in i satiated . the voice acting be terrific ; usually you do not get this much dialogue in a game . i like that you do not have to read all of the dialogue if you do not want to ; just sit back and let the character talk . i will say there be a learning curve as with most game . after have to re-start 2 time already , i have learn to save my progress multiple time just in case i make a stupid decision when fuse demon or buy the wrong demon or something . it be a pain to start over after put in 8 hour of gameplay . it can be easy to ` paint yourself into a corner ' so to speak if you do not know what you be do at first . so i hope my review help you decide if you want to purchase this game . really , i do not think you can go wrong with this one !

457	Video_Games	POS	4	this game have the potential to be very good , and on the other system i be sure it be so , but for the wii the control degrade from full enjoyment . for example , you use the wiimote to change you view and shoot , while you use the nunchuck to walk and strafe . the jerky motion of the wiimote , which be difficult to properly stabilize , give the player the impression that they be a one-legged , drunken monkey , all the while try to peg scream german . if you buy this game , do not buy it for wii !

498	Video_Games	POS	5	my review of resident evil 4 this have get to be one of the greatest game ever . i really cant remember the last time i have so much fun play a videogame , i really can not . i even have more fun play this game then halo 2 . from the start , resident evil 4 immerse you into world that taunt you to keep explore it ; to survive it . it do this through a phenomenal mixture of great story tell , awe-inspiring visual , mood-setting music , a wonderful variety of sound , and near perfect control -lrb- and yes , i be base my score off of ign.com 's score tool -rrb- presentation : 10\/10 i be sure you have all hear the story by now ; the president 's daughter get kidnap by a unknown group of people , and you , leon kennedy of re2 fame , be send on a solo mission to find and rescue she no matter what the cost . it be a very basic premise that quickly evolve into something much more -lrb- i will not spoil anything here because it be much more satisfying figure it out on you own -rrb- . and yes , there be no zombie in this game . but i do not think you will miss they . and no , the enemy be not human either . to find out what they be , you be go to have to play through the story yourself . a very engaging story quickly develop through a series of discover write document , radio transmission and fantastic cutscene which all run in-game like in metroid prime 2 or in metal gear solid : the twin snakes . and like in those game , there be absolutely no need to make cg cut scene . any use of cg animation would ultimately interrupt the flow of the gaming experience . that and because the in-game graphic be utterly amazing . graphic : 10\/10 the graphic ... oh the sweet , sweet graphic . never have i see such realistic fire and water effect . never have i see environment so meticulously detail , so wonderfully streamlined together that you could honestly believe that the world the game introduce to you could be real . the character model be also very well do , even if you see the same 5 villager model over , and over , and over . leon kennedy look amazingly cool , and ashley appearance convey the perfect look of a frightened and vulnerable damsel in distress . and the character model of the bad guy , from lord saddler to the `` big cheese , '' really embody the sense of evil -lrb- although the little guy who be the caretaker of the castle do not seem all that frightening -rrb- . i could go on and on about every little graphical detail that capcom stuff into this game -lrb- like the amazing water and rain effect and the scary use of lightning -rrb- , but to wrap this up , let just say that you could buy this game for the sole purpose to look at it and you would be please . sound : 10\/10 now sound be always a important part of any game . it enhance and set the mood and immerse you in a world that you can only wish to live in , or in the case of resident evil 4 , make you glad that you do not . the music in resident evil 4 be creepy and frightening and do a extraordinary job of enhance the unsettling atmosphere . -lrb- although , sometimes the lack of music can be freaky as well -rrb- . and all the sound effect in the game be perfectly use . for example , when you be walk up a wooden staircase in order to enter a spooky look house ; you can hear you footstep resonate and echo on the wooden stair . and when you be in the castle you can hear the monk ' murmur get louder and louder and louder , as they approach . which also bring up the point that if you know any spanish you will be in for a treat since that be the language that the enemy speak in , another fine example of capcom completely immerse you into a believable eastern european setting . voice act be spot-on and professionally do . i love all the voice and i congratulate capcom for find such talented actor . sound effect for gun be also very distinct and extremely well do , but there be not a lot of time to think about the sound of you gun when enemy be surround you from every direction . gameplay : 10\/10 i play this game with a friend take turn at the control when we die or finish a chapter and we play for eight hour straight only take quick break to go to the bathroom . we do not eat , we do not drink . we just turn off the light and play all night . we be really that addict . the gameplay here be so fast pace that it be easy to forget how much time have pass since start -lrb- although whenever you save at a typewriter you will be remind of it -rrb- . enemy be smart and aggressive . not all of they will attack you by run straight at you . they will flank you and swarm at you from all direction . a lot have the ability to use a wide range of weapon from pitchfork , torch , crossbow , mace , axis , dynamite and the very frightening chainsaw -lrb- although the guy carry the chainsaw be not a ordinary villager and be extremely difficult to kill -rrb- . but do not worry because you can hit a lot of weapon right out of enemy hand -lrb- not the chainsaw though -rrb- which bring i to another very interesting point of game play ; enemy will react differently depend on where you hit they . for example , if you shoot a villager in the leg , he 'll stumble and fall . if you shoot they in the head , they head will either explode or they 'll hold they face in pain -lrb- it depend on how powerful you gun be -rrb- . this be actually the only shooting game i have play that you can aim at enemy ankle and win a fight . it be very impressive how much this feature influence the flow of battle . for instance , if you only have ammo for you weakest gun such as you pistol and several enemy be advance on you quickly , it be usually a good idea to shoot at they leg so you can make they fall and slow down they advance . other time , it be a good idea to land a head shot which will hopefully decapitate the assailant and make he fall to the ground . -lrb- headshot however , will sometimes be a bad idea later on in the game . you will know what i mean when you see it -rrb- . sometimes you can make enemy fall to they knee allow you to go up to they and press the `` a '' button to let loose a powerful kick . this bring up another important aspect of game play , the context-sensitive action button which will help you perform a wide variety of task from jump out of window to sprint away from fall boulder . it be truly a marvel on how much this simple button can do . boss battle in resident evil be among some of the best . whether it be the squirm terror of the mouth of `` del lago '' the horrifying , demented body of the `` big cheese '' -lrb- not actually make of cheese , but that be what everyone call he for some reason -rrb- , or the killing grip of `` el gigante , '' boss will make you think , make you act quickly and make you cry out in frustration as you die many , many time -lrb- trust i on this on this one -rrb- . you do not shoot randomly while face a boss ; you mostly find you self run , try you best to avoid they deadly move and find a opening for a well aim gunshot . thankfully , you do not have to protect ashley during most boss scene . ashley be the reason you be send to this murderous little village , and she safety be the only thing that will allow you out . once you find she , ashley will follow you wherever you go , and she be sometimes essential to figure out certain puzzle . you press the x button to make she switch between follow you and stay right where she be . but be careful , if you leave she all alone she might be pick up by one of you numerous foe who will carry she to the nearest exit . if you let they escape , then the game be over . a quick gun shot to the leg however , will make the kidnapper drop she . but be careful here as well , because if you accidentally kill ashley -lrb- like i ` ve do on several occasion -rrb- , then the game be over . when she drop to the ground , she will automatically run up behind you . if you need to turn around to shoot or shoot any enemy near she , she will quickly duck allow you to get a clear shot at you enemy -lrb- but be sure to withdraw you gun when you want she to run , because she 'll stay crouch as long as you point you gun near she -rrb- . ashley rarely become a real annoyance for i and my friend . she fit very well into the structure of the game and be easy to control indirectly . when you have to directly control she , the game fill with tension since she be arm only with a flashlight and nothing else -lrb- one particular scene involve some murderous suit of armor make my heart pound -rrb- . the only thing we get mad about be that we have to spend we precious herb on she when she get hurt , make we go into furious , heart racing battle with little to no health -lrb- a minor complaint however because you can continue the game over and over when you die , usually from the spot right before you die -rrb- at certain point during battle -lrb- and during movie -rrb- the l and r button or the a and b button can be press at the same time to perform a dodge move . the game will tell when to press they and it like the change what set of button you press in order to dodge . this make you play the game by the seat of you pants , force you to have the controller in you hand at all time and always be on the lookout for chance to dodge -lrb- once during a movie , my friend put the controller down as he be accustom to . then all of the sudden , the game tell we to press land r to dodge . we both dive for the controller but it be too late . blood go fly everywhere and we be roll on the floor laughing -rrb- . other gameplay element include the very important position of the camera , which be always behind you and will zoom up to look over you shoulder when aim you weapon . this allow a uninterrupted gaming experience and no confusion when change you direction . controls work wonderfully . i have never play a resident evil game before , but i have hear that the control have not change much at all . hold b to run . hold r to aim and a to shoot and hold l to pull out you knife and press a to use it . they really be very simple , and easy to use and master -lrb- although my friend keep think he be play madden 2005 and keep press the y button to run . but that be a different story -rrb- . when you be aim you stand completely still which may bother some people but it really do enhance the atmosphere and make you really feel like you be try to survive . the only complaint i have about the control be that it do not allow you to switch weapon on the fly . you constantly have to go back to the inventory screen to pick a weapon . i would of prefer if they make the d-pad switch weapon but sadly it be just there as a alternative to the control stick . but this be just a minor complaint . the last aspect of gameplay would be the inventory screen , the weapon , and the merchant . you inventory screen be a grid . each item that you have , except for treasure and key item , will take up a certain number of box of the grid , which can severely limit what you can carry -lrb- if you have play deus ex or diablo ii , then you should you be familiar with this type of inventory . -rrb- but do not worry , you can buy bigger inventory from the merchant , who be nearly everywhere in the game . -lrb- whether it be one merchant or a clan of merchant be unknown , however if you kill a merchant , they will disappear for the entire game -rrb- . the merchant will buy treasure from you and sell you weapon in return . he list of weapon will grow during the course of the game , so do not worry if he selection seem rather limit at the start . he can also tune up you gun , which add a rpg quality to the game . you can increase the firepower , reload time , firing speed , and bullet capacity for nearly all of you gun for a price that increase with each new level you upgrade they to . this feature enhance the game experience extensively since you often will make choice on what aspect of you gun to upgrade while consider all the different type of battle situation -lrb- do you want you tmp to kill more people with less shot , or do you want it to be able to carry a lot more ammo than it normally do ? -rrb- replay value : 8\/10 from what i have hear , most people take around 20 hour to complete this game . but believe i , those will be the most exciting , the most rewarding , the most challenging and often the most frightening 20 hour in you life . and you rarely have to backtrack so you will see a whole lot during those 24 hour . i be not even on the second disc yet but i know that once i finish this game , i 'll be back again to play it on a harder mode . there be also a lot of thing to collect and perfectionist will be itch at the chance to go back , since the game record you accuracy , the amount of enemy you kill , and the amount of time you die after each chapter . there be also mini-game hide throughout the game and i have hear that there be another mini-game that you unlock after you beat the game . but this game be not like animal crossing of the sims or a mmo . this game will eventually see it be shelf life on the top of my 24 game collection . but even then , i will be proud to own it . summary : presentation : 10\/10 a great story full of mystery , conspiracy , and action . it will keep you hooked and make you nibble on that hook in hope of be drag deeper and deeper into the plot . great visual , excellent cut scene , a wonderful script and it be all present in letterbox mode make it seem as if you be control a fantastical movie . graphic : 10\/10 anything less would be blasphemy . simply put , this be one of the best look game , ever . play it use progressive scan mode to make you unworthy eye see something utterly amazing . sound : 10\/10 a impressive array of sound from gunshot blast , to explode head . voice act be top notch , and the music provide a wonderfully scary ambient noise to the background . play it with dolby surround sound to hear you foe creep up behind you . i just love the sound in this game . gameplay : 10\/10 combat never get old . the action button really enhance the experience as it allow you to do much more , and the boss battle provide new standard of what a boss battle should be . i can not even remember the last time that i have have so much fun with a video game . replay value : 8\/10 at 20 hour , it be a little on the short side . but believe i , those will be the most exciting , the most rewarding , the most challenging and often the most frightening 20 hour in you life . i be plan on go through it again once i be do . final score -lrb- not a average -rrb- : 9.9 \/ 10 okay , be you do reading ? good ! now find some cash and go to you nearest videogame retailer and buy this game . you will not regret it . what ?! you can not find any money ? then go couch-diving for penny , open up you saving 's account , sell you child ! you get my point do not you ? you must own this game ! closing comment : a little public service announcement resident evil 4 be rate m for a reason . there be a extreme amount of violence and gore in here and leon often swear , especially when ashley be steal from he -lrb- on numerous occasion -rrb- . seriously now , you should not let younger kid watch this game , much less play it . it do become scary very quickly -lrb- although i find most of the experience exciting , instead of scary -rrb- and if you let you son or daughter play this , make sure that they know the difference between reality and virtual reality . we do not want any kid discover they father 's gun and try to see if people 's head really do explode when shoot at . and i always hate it when parent get mad about violence in game when they should never have buy they kid the game in the first place . so keep i happy , and buy this game , just do not let any youngin ' see it . -
773	Video_Games	POS	5	pro : really great game . it have a really different art style that be interesting . the plot make sense . and the game of the year edition come with a map , -lrb- which isnt really helpful , but on the other side be a poster -rrb- all addon for the game and beta access to duke nukem : forever -lrb- which i havnt try -rrb- . the game style be kind of interesting , it be a different spin on rpg . when you think of rpg , you think of zelda , those kind of game . but it be really a first person shooter , mix with a role play game . also , there be over 1 million different gun . you 'll never find the same gun twice . when you find a better one , you just keep it and sell you old one . con : not enough ammo , it seem like there just be not ever enough ammo . i guess it just make the game more interesting . i guess that be not really a con . this game be a must buy if you friend have it . even if they do not , still i would highly recommend it .

742	Video_Games	POS	4	the metal gear solid series be not the sort of thing for everyone . it be not really intend to be a first person shooter , for starter . secondly , it be not suppose to be a perfect re-creation of reality . as it have be mention by the creator , hideo kojima , time and time again , if mg be a perfect simulation of reality , the hero of the series , snake , would not last more than a few minute in all likelihood . third , mgs be still limit by the technical limitation of the technology -lrb- which i will get to later -rrb- . and above all else , mg be about sneak , and rewarding stealthy behavior . this be a bit too -lrb- ... -rrb- retentive for most people , but for other , it be highly enjoyable . to each he own ... anyhow , down to the good and bad random though about this game , which i finally finish early yesterday morning : i love the graphic of this game . mgs have already try to push the boundary of the playstation hardware , and it do not fail here . there be time when there be slowdown -lrb- e.g. too many explosion and people on the screen at the same time -rrb- , but it be very rare unless you happen to be goof around try to attack a whole platoon at the same time . even the there have to be lot of explosion occur at the same time . mechanics-wise , yes , the camera be awful , and make this game so much harder to play . it do not make sense to be move around and accidentally bump into a enemy . konami need to fix this in the next iteration of mgs , b\/c it be become a linger handicap that scare alot of people away from enjoy the game . i have read from other review though that this be not really they fault ... it be the fact that if mg be implement use a 3rd-person camera as in splinter cell , it would perform very poorly on the ps2 -lrb- as demonstrate by the ps2 version of splinter cell -rrb- . the game , outside of the strange quirkiness in the dialogue , have some funny dialogue to keep the player amuse from time to time . especially for the people who hate mgs2 , there be a good joke at the beginning . = -rrb- the emotional impact of the dialogue be dilute by some of the voice-acting , especially in the end . i feel that david hayter -lrb- who voice snake -rrb- , need to pace some of he line a little bit better , b\/c he still sound like he be read they too much . but it be a welcome thing to hear he gruff voice again . ditto for the boss and eva . it be hard ... american version still have alot of work to do in regard to match the quality of voice-act to they japanese counterpart . plot-wise ... mgs3 be not as interesting as the original mgs , but the gameplay more than make up for the weaker , less engaging storyline . in term of the ai ... i mean , what do people expect ? yeah , if you assassinate somebody with a sniper rifle , of course , in real life , people would be look for you and be on high alert for hour , try to hunt you down to kill you . but this be a game and thus only a imitation of the way thing `` would '' be . it be definitely a pain in this game to have to sit around for 2 + minute at a time wait for the alarm to settle down though , i think that be plenty sufficient . the ai 's actually quite aggressive when you be discover , they seem to have get smarter of attack as a group . there be some mediocre boss fight , and then there be some interesting one as well . my favorite be the one against the enemy sniper , the end . it be satisfy to figure out how to beat he . the boss here be more fun to approach than the one in mgs2 . in regard to gameplay , the camouflage can become a bit repetitive . it be unnatural , and too bad , that the player can not quickly equip a gun when wear certain uniform in this game ... that restriction should not have be put in place . the same go for the cure system . the food be just as redundant , but it be fun to hear the reaction of the character and to be challenge in find food . it may have be `` unrealistic '' in how much damage snake could take in the game , but that be to offset the fact that eat food in the game do not help you recover health ... it only help in make sure that you regeneration rate remain high . the plethora of weapon in this new mgs3 be great . love it !! i like how the structure be alot less linear ... it be still drive by a linear story , but at least , you be give more option as to how to approach certain enemy or even simply different sequence in the game . if you do not feel like go stealthy , that be fine , you can create a bloodbath and kill everybody on a particular level . on the other hand , you can take the quiet approach . you have that freedom , whereas in the previous game , if you try to pull that , you would go down in less than a minute . cqc be a welcome addition . it be still a bit too simplistic , but the gamepad 's only get so many button on it , so i be not sure how the depth in hand-to-hand combat could be expand opon , save for maybe include some clever sfius button and stick combination ... lol . that might be sweet . maybe as a bonus konami could enable snake to do a dragon punch if you complete the game once or something like that . it be a good first effort into broaden what snake can do . the knife be a nice addition . it would have be better if snake could kill people who be knock out on the ground with one stroke , but hey , at least a knife be include in this game . the cqc knife 's a little bit too sensitive , if you be clumsy it be too easy to kill people by accident when try to interrogate they at time , at least when you be first try to learn . the u.s version do not include a cut-scene theater , which be a shame . = -lrb- all in all , i would not go so far as to call this the `` best game ever make , '' but it be fun , enjoyable , and i look forward to future release in mg or whatever it be go to be call .

30	Video_Games	POS	5	i be a avid fan of nintendo . still , i feel the release of the 3d be a bit rush . the launch game be lack , be mostly remake or gimmicky game try to show off the capability of the new system . with this game however , nintendo hit the sweet spot . they have make a truly amazing game on they revolutionary new console . the platform feel spot on , with game play from 2d and 3d mario game . if i have to describe it , i would say it be 2.5 d , if that make any sense . it be like a 2d platformer , but instead of have just a foreground to play in , you play in multiple foreground and background . this game have tanookus fever . there be tanookus goomba , tanooki bullet bill , tanookus bowser , and of course , tanookus mario . defeat goomba with my tail be something i have not do since mario 3 . this game be huge . in order to have a 5 star file you have to complete all level , get all the star coin , complete all level as luigi , get to the top of every flagpole , and get to the top of every flagpole as luigi . con : the tanookus suit make thing almost too easy , it almost feel like cheating . in the last couple of level be hard in a bad way . they only give you 30 seconds to complete they , with clock scatter over the level that give you 10 extra seconds . and they use shadow clone , shadowy mario doppleganger that follow you every move , damage you if they touch you . it make i feel as if i be run out of a building that be go to explode with a gunman chasing after i . overall , the good outweigh the bad , give you no reason to pass up on this game .

826	Video_Games	POS	4	i should start off this review by say gears 3 be my first gears title and , after complete it , it most definitely will not be my last . i also should add i be a huge sci-fus shooter fan -lrb- since the halo day , or at least the beginning of halo day since halo 4 be right around the corner -rrb- , so gears of war 3 be right down my alley , and yet i do not leave the game after i beat it with the same sense of awe and wonder i feel after halo 1-3 . gears 3 be certainly good , one of the best look game on the xbox 360 and the end boss and cutscene really cement my appreciation for this title , but the gameplay and control feel clunky , almost as if they be themselves grind away and heavily burden like the character ' suit . the charging\/run feature be odd to i , since you hunker down in a crouch and the screen become slightly warped - and there do not seem to be a exact direction except in a very general sense when you try to run one way or the other . the voice acting be atrocious most of the time , save for the always amazing claudia black -lrb- who have a somewhat limited role in comparison to that of she chloe counterpart in uncharted 2 -rrb- . the story itself be equally typical save-the-world-from-infestation schlock and unique , and - as i previously mention - the end leave i with appreciation , but , again , not in the same way other sci-fi shooter have -lrb- under-appreciated lose planet 2 , one of my fave of 2010 , include -rrb- . overall , i recommend pick up a copy of gears of war 3 as obviously it be a good game that diehard gears fan love , but for a newbie like i perhaps a gears 4 will merit whether i love it or leave it .

599	Video_Games	POS	4	for anyone who own a n64 during the mid 90 's , ask they to name one game they play on it and they will say goldeneye . the title alone bring first person shooter to the console and player ever could jump in and play . fast forward to the year 2009 where activision make the announcement that they be make a remake to the classic n64 shooter ; some gamer rejoice while other be a bit cautious . it cause quite a debate between those who love the game as it be and those who be ready to see how it would turn out . the remake be release on the nintendo wii in 2010 and overall , it be a good remake and worth check out for anyone who be currently into play first person shooter and\/or love the original title . goldeneye 007 be the remake to the n64 title make back in 1997 by rare base on the james bond movie of the same name . in the main single player mode , you control james bond in several stage where you must complete certain objective , rescue hostage and make it all the way to stop the main villain from use a satellite to destroy the world . then there be the multiplayer mode comprise of two part : local multiplayer where up to 4 player play against each other and online multiplayer where up to 8 player can shoot it out against each other or in team during each match . both mode offer different match scenario and a sizable chunk of option include time limit , weapon , handicap setting and stage . online multiplayer also offer player the chance to earn experience point to increase you rank , overall score and the ability to unlock different weapon , gadget , special attribute while online achievement also reward you with experience point . controls be a big focus here as you be able to control turn speed -lrb- leave to right , up and down -rrb- , customize you button -lrb- or select preset configuration -rrb- , music & sound volume and what kind of controller you can use -lrb- wii remote w \/ nunchuk , gamecube controller and classic\/classic pro controller be all support . -rrb- if you use the wii remote , the customization ability go even further . since this be a big game to cover , i will give my pro and con for the single player mode , local multiplayer and online multiplayer . single player mode this be a remake and that mean there be some change make between the classic shooter and the modern version . first off , not all the original character be represent here -lrb- pierce brosnan be replace by daniel craig , the nerdy russian programmer , gadget master `` q '' and moneypenny be go and with the exception of `` m '' , all of the remain character look different . second , part of the story have be change with some scene entirely take off . lastly , it be set in modern time so it have a more current of event type of feel to it . the pro : eurocom and activision do a great job in bring this game to the modern era of video game . the graphic , presentation and overall feel like you be right in the middle of the action . the sound and music be top notch while the control be easy to customize and learn no matter what kind of controller you use -lrb- by the way , use the wii remote and nunchuk be the best way to experience this game , in my opinion . -rrb- everything from the location , the character , the game mechanic and option be faithfully recreate as if you be play the original goldeneye . the difficulty level from the original game be here as well as the number of objective you have to complete : the higher the difficulty , the more objective you must complete . level be long , detailed and they all have save point scatter so you can always take a break and come back to where you leave off . quick time event be mix into the action and do not feel like it be a afterthought at all . the cut scene be well do and never overstay its welcome unlike from other game . the con : if you be a die hard fan of the original and prefer to keep the original as be , then this game be not for you as there be change make here and there . again , this come down to whether you can play through a remake of one of you favorite game and not complain about the change you see . the only complaint i can say here be while the graphic be as good as they get , i can imagine some people say it belong on the ps3 or xbox 360 and that be just ridiculous . it will not look as good if it come out on the other console , but it be still a good effort . local multiplayer & online multiplayer the pro : if you option , you get they . the original title be know for its multiplayer mode and the remake do not disappoint . everything that be part of the multiplayer from the classic title make it here , complete with update graphic , sound , music and controller customization . up to 4 player can shoot it out and it feel like the good old day . so if you get friend , try out the local multiplayer . as for online multiplayer , only one person be allow on each wii to go online . online multiplayer be completely different but just as fun . connect online be easy and when you create a profile , you can see how many achievement you earn , you rank & score , you friend list and set up different weapon profile setup -lrb- up to 5 -rrb- and select they on the fly . as you rank up and get better , you be reward with better weapon , useful gadget and special attribute . all of the weapon you use have they own achievement award and the more you use they , the more effective they become . with different match happen under various scenario , you will not have a problem jump into a game . exchange friend code be useful since you can join you friend ' match whenever they be online . the con : local multiplayer be just that which mean you do not earn point and unlock achievement . online multiplayer be not perfect for a few reason . first off , expect to see hacker and funny activity so if you do not want to deal with that , just leave the match you be play in and get into another one . second , sometimes match be interrupted if the host of the match lose his\/her connection or leave the match entirely . there will be a time when , for whatever reason , you lose you connection and return to the lobby to choose another match to get into . thirdly , you have to adjust you control and button prior to log online . if you do not like how it control , you 'll have to log out entirely and get to the option screen to make you change . lastly , when you first start out , it will be hard for you since you 'll be up against player that be more experienced . tough it out , get as many experience point as you can and you will get better as time pass and it will be fun . the game for the most part turn out for the most part to be a success . it be worthy of the goldeneye name and be worth check out whether by yourself , with friend or go online to play with\/against other .

79	Video_Games	POS	4	i 'll be honest upfront . from the beginning , i hate this game . the amount of technical issue be inexcusable . while the art style and color be beautiful , the texture be muddy , screen-tearing abound , and never have i see so many object and texture pop-in in a game . the audio 's volume level seem to be all over the place , with dialog be particularly low , keep i from get much investment in the story -- there be even one point where certain sound-effect and all dialog go completely mute . but most of all , it be not very much fun , as the majority of the gameplay seem to be tedious climbing and get across danger zone fill with object you arbitrarily could or could not climb . but there come a point in the game where this turn around . and i think i can tell you exactly where this point happen : when you leave new york . it might also be argue that it be when you get the cloud , but i feel that be just the beginning of the change . after this point , the gameplay start to become more and more varied . stunning environment begin to mask technical deficiency -- either that , or the programmer actually improve as the game go on . character interaction become more engrossing . by the end , the game become enjoyable enough to ignore its technical flaw and ho-hum beginning . i get a distinct feeling that the developer have a really grand vision for the game , and while for whatever reason -- whether it be not enough time , money or talent -- it do not live up to that vision , it be still a wonderful ride in its own right , and where that grand vision glimpse out at certain moment of the game , it really shine .

444	Video_Games	POS	4	call of duty black op be the 5th cod installment for the ps3 . while it have its moment of great fun and entertainment , it just seem to be lack a little bit when compare to the modern warfare game . while i have hear mixed opinion of the game , from its lack in graphic compare to mw to the enjoyment of a older war -lrb- but not wwii old -rrb- , i be not sure what to expect . after play the game through on single player , i find all of the aforementioned statement to be accurate . the time frame be great . while i love the mw game , and will always enjoy a good wwii game , it be nice to be able to play a game set during lesser covered war and time period . this time open the door for different weaponry , both arms\/chemical weapon and military grade vehicle , as well as differ approach to historical event and method of interrogation . all of these area be welcome in a market that have be quickly saturate with fp military game . the game be graphically sound . sure it be not up to par with mw , but do all game really need to be ? the entertainment factor more than make up for what be very good graphic any way . character , weaponry , and environment all have great detail . the game 's biggest downfall , in my opinion , be the fact that it take place through memory during a less-than-friendly interrogation conduct by unknown person . this be exactly what ea 's battlefield 3 have do more recently . it be not the past tense time frame that bother i but rather the interrogation between each level . it be very repetitive and between catch the player off-guard in the begin to deliver a shocking ending , it become little more than a dull load-time in the middle . overall , this be a good game . if you be a single player person and do not have any cod yet , i would suggest mw 1 and\/or 2 . if you be online focus , this be probably a better choice as it be newer . either way , it be worth playing .

384	Video_Games	POS	4	the nintendo wii be not a friendly environment for first person shooter which be a shame because the wiimote\/nanchuk be a awesome substitute for the mouse\/keyboard combo . no , the main problem be that fps 's tend to push system to they limit and the fact of the matter be that compare to compete system the wii be a wimpy little girl at polygon push . i be play fps 's on the pc well over a half decade ago with better graphic than the latest goldeneye and a game like call of duty on xbox or ps3 look so much better and run so much smoother which be why i tend to stick to game within the wii 's graphical capability like punch out and mario kart . goldeneye be a excellent fp compare to other on the wii but compare to cod4 : modern warfare on xbox it be quite ugly . the big question be why goldeneye . goldeneye be one of the most ground breaking first person shooter ever and a game that i put many many hour into . it be also by far the best pierce brosnan bond movie . this goldeneye be a re-imagining of the movie radically change the story . the character name remain the same -lrb- orumov , trevelyan , simonova -rrb- but they be completely change and unrecognizable from the original character and none of the change be improvement . onatopp , for instance look like cruella deville in a pimp costume and sadly boris grishenko be completely jettison . the plot be change so that bond appear in all the event of the story for instance bond be at severnaya when the goldeneye blast hit . in order to get bond there the writer include a full attack on the severnaya base by russian soldier under orumov 's order . the severnaya guard send out a alert pick up by mi6 who then send bond to investigate . this do not make sense on several level . first of all the whole point of steal the emp resistant helicopter be so that orumov could draw as little attention to himself as possible as he steal the goldeneye code from the almost completely unguarded research station . have this massive assault make the tiger helicopter essentially superfluous and make it pretty much impossible that orumov could get with he scheme without everyone know he do it . the game retain the interrogation scene almost word for word but how could defense minister mishkin possibly think bond be behind the theft of the goldeneye ? do bond also command dozen if not hundred of russian troops to attack the facility ? in almost every case where the character or plot be change it be to the detriment of the story . goldeneye get the control scheme correct with the wiimote\/nanchuk . you move with the nanchuk control stick and control direction with the wiimote so you direction essentially follow the reticule . there be strafing , run and gun and lean which in my opinion be absolute must but i still see fps 's that do not have they . press ` z ' button give you limited lock-on but it can be frustrate when the game decide to lock on something other than what you be try to hit . the biggest problem be that the gun seem to have serious problem aim high and low . targeting upward will generally give you a angry red circle with a line through meaning you can not fire which can be brutal when someone be shoot you from above . likewise there can be some frustration when try to shoot downward . also , the control can sometimes seem to get lose and just float around or lock up . by and large when i be run and gun through a area i be fine and loving it but the target problem come along more than occasionally . there be one part in the game where i need to escape a burning train by shoot off some lock and my aim absolutely refuse to respond elicit more than a bit of profanity . i can not overstate how much of a problem this can be when the control suddenly refuse to obey . i can not deny there be much awesomeness to be have in the new goldeneye . the sniper rifle and night vision goggles be do well and i love the tank section although the end where bond stop orumov 's train be lame compare to the movie . player can play more of a stealth game -lrb- which be do exceedingly well -rrb- or shoot they way through the whole thing . the control scheme be do well if a bit bitchy and often frustrating . personally i do not like that they use goldeneye because it be neither a homage to the original rare game nor a improvement on the story of the film . the memorial park scene be a great level but the end be terrible compare to the film on the other hand the ` cradle ' scene be a sight to behold . this be the first bond game i have buy in year and i would have to say that for its era this be the second best bond game i have play after the original goldeneye and the best fp i have see on the wii . goldeneye game show a lot of effort put into it include a really slick menu system but there be some graphical glich like float gun and fall through the ground that take i back but not in a good way . i have criticize a lot but this be a quality game if you can overlook a few very frustrating issue . just do not set you expectation too high or you might be disappoint .

322	Video_Games	POS	4	first , if you love the original , you 'll be just as addict to this one . i be lucky enough to pre-order , so i have have a chance to play it for awhile . several thing have change , mostly good , some which take some get use to , and a few bad . so far the latter have add some confusion and annoyance which keep i from give it the five star i want to give it . good change - no more run about look for special visitor ; they all show up at the town hall ... you animal neighbor be much funnier ... it be easy to get very funny response to letter -lrb- altho ' in the past , all you need be a exclamation point and a question mark to get a positive response -rrb- ... be able to take fossil straight to blathers be a huge time savings , and visit the coffeehouse and draw constellation in the museum basement and attic , respectively , be a lot of fun -lrb- especially watch you hand-drawn constellation float by overhead at night -rrb- ... there be a huge number of new fish , new fossil , and new bug to find - no more trudge along the beach in winter scarf up only a pile of miserable sea bass ... now you buy you clothes at the able 's shop , and the many new accessory be hysterical - i spend one day run around in a native american warbonnet and a pacifier -lrb- do not realize i have the pacifier attach -rrb- ... the bulletin board be actually use ... pelly work late -lrb- do not have to see phyllis til really late -rrb- ... you house can be huge -lrb- 3 extra room , plus the usual large expansion ... you can put you own artwork on easel in you house and decorate the path outside with the same in graffitus square ... the path system be nice -lrb- much less bang into tree while run around -rrb- ... you can pick and then replant many kind of flower , put they in you hair , or drop they in you home as a decoration ... some bug be only attract to certain flower , so you do have to plant they all ... change that take get use to : not be able right away to ask you neighbor for errand to run - you have to wait until they begin to warm up to you , and then you still can not ask - they ask you instead ... you can really hasten this effect by waive to they as you pass ... use the stylus be awkward at first , but then you begin to see how really effective it be - write letter , drag thing around in you menu , etc. , become much easier ... you barely have to touch it though , which take some get use to , to relax you grip ... even with all the new and improved bug and fish , it seem to take more time to earn money now , especially with have to wait on you neighbor to warm up ... one very funny effect , as neighbor move in , they house stay fill with packing box for a day or two - only then can you investigate they home ... there be no island , so coconut wash up in the beach , along with message in bottle ... thing i have trouble with : the `` scrolling world '' -lrb- think sonic 3-d -rrb- make it difficult to shoot down present etc , because you have to race `` up '' the world to bring the present into closer view , and then race about try to line up you shot - it appear you need to have the floater directly overhead and not `` in-the-distance-overhead '' - for you shot to work ... also , you tend not to focus on the top screen , so if you miss the sound clue you may miss action on the top screen altogether - there be a lot of sound in this game , so it be not hard to do ... fishing be harder - thing dart about and change direction , often swim offscreen by the time you cast you line - sometimes more than one fish will come to you - unlike the first game , where a visible tug-and-splash show you have a bite , in this game , the only clue be a audible `` plop '' sound - so you be listen , not see , which be awkward . booker seem not to know when visitor show up - and since they show up at the town hall , what be the point ? - and you never get to talk to copper unless you be do wi-fus ... also , catch the proverbial mole cricket -lrb- the only winter bug available , really -rrb- have prove impossible for i at least ... you dig it up , but by the time you get you shovel put away and get you net out , it have crawl off and disappear - catch thing happen in real time - the game do not freeze action , so it be like a active-time-battle in a standard rpg . finally , the official game guide be puzzling - clothes be give huge up close shot -lrb- so you can copy design ? -rrb- -rrb- but item and furniture , etc , be tiny dark picture with no definition at all ... very wierd .

297	Video_Games	POS	5	i 'll start off with this . if you love splinter cell conviction you will like\/love this game . i be a third person shooter fan , when it come to shooter . the game-play be similar to splinter cell conviction . the control to get into and out of cover be a little tricky to manage at first , but i be so stick on conviction for so long i expect the same and it be not . there be a focus fire system , similar to the mark and execute system , but the enemy have to be in front of you for it to work , unlike conviction . you can have a max of three and need to do a hand to hand take down to get one . if you a die hard fp fanboy , -lrb- which seem to be 99 % of the xbox crowd -rrb- well you wont like it . its the only reason i can see for the multiple negative review here . the drive sequence be amazingly fun , and the drive smooth , as expect from a game maker who make racing game primarily . the graphic be a bit tone down for multiplayer , but i be okay with that if it make for smoother game-play , and it do . the graphic be not n64 quality as i have see other reviewer compare it too , i have no idea where this comparison come from . my one major complaint be the complete lack of gadgets\/grenades and no crouch . i can not understand how this vital feature of a partial stealth game could be miss . stand up while go from cover to cover in the face of full gunfire make this game ridiculously difficult at time . you use you smartphone to scan and it go fuzzy when move , similar to the sonar goggles of conviction . but overll this be only my second game that i be try to complete the cheevo 's on , the other be scconviction . the multiplayer lobby be still active and its possible to get the mp cheevos\/trophy 's as well . well worth the current price of $ 18.00 , once you get over the lack of crouching in this game .

901	Video_Games	POS	4	pick this up from the ps + free-bee for april . have not have much time to really play it till this past weekend . i never try the first shift , so i can not compare it to that one . also i have only just start play this title this past weekend . this will only be my first impression of this game with more to come . i have to say that i do not know anything of this game before play it . i have play many of the nf series game since the original release back in the early to mid 90 's . i have be a racing fan since pole position on the atari -lrb- s -rrb- , arcaders like out run or super off road with sims such as hard drivin ' . ha-ha ! seriously though , i have . so i have try many title in my year of gaming . arcaders and sims alike . i give they all a fair try before knock they . the nf series have let i down in the past on a few of they release . mostly i know nf as a arcade style , run from the cop , racer with detailed beautiful exotic . the undercover series , or as i refer to they as `` the fast n furious era '' , have some positive , but go in a unfamiliar direction . after those i avoid nfs : shift . i hear that it get decent review , but i have decide to move on from it . those positive point on shift persuade i into run out and snag a copy of the re-release of `` hot pursuit '' in 2010 . i have be rock that for the past 2 year plus . last year when shift 2 unleash be release i do not even remember that it be a nf title . i have be eyeball the latest nf , `` the run '' , since play the demo . so i like racer and nf racer i know ... except for these on the `` shift '' line ... till now . my first glance at shift 2 unleash have i excited . the graphic and audio be very well do . they produce a amazing look and feel opening sequence . i also notice that they use autolog like in nfs : hot pursuit -lrb- 2010 -rrb- . i be a huge fan of that feature . if you do not know , find out . the menu be uniquely display and easy to navigate . the menu item regard game play display completion percentage . that be more than welcome . when you get into play it they start you out on a test play . this be sweet ! upon completion of the test you be provide with what nfs think would work for you as far as race setting go . i personally know that i just need a few lap to get the feel of the control down . so you can accept they as nf suggest or retry it . so i do a few attempt ... about 3 or so . afterwards my suggest setting be now accord to the way i last drive as oppose to the first attempt . that be the sweet spot ! ; - -rrb- they start you out with another race and give you cheddar to spend on a new whip . i be assume , depend on how you do on the first race , will determine the amount provide for use on you car . i be think that i do not do so well . i have enough for a ford mo-focus and a upgrade or two . the upgrade on the vehicle be similar to other nfs game . mostly all of they be performance upgrade . there be not any pointless ground glow and window tint kit here . they also throw in upgrade package that be many optimal upgrade for you vehicle . i have only just begin to play this game , so my only vehicle be the mo-focus . i be hope that the kit vary from vehicle to vehicle . the upgrade also show a number system for the increase of what area of effect it 'll have on you vehicle . also you vehicle will gain performance value as you upgrade it . this must come in handy with the ai and also boast on-line ranking . example being ; if you have a top time on a track with a mo-focus and you performance value be 500 , and i hold second by a tenth of a second behind with my mo-focus , which be value at 300 , you probably do not have much bragging room , and if i take first place i will be gloat . race do take some get use to when you first start . adjustment have a effect too and might throw you off some , so be cautious when upgrade . there be the traditional drive view of 1st or 3rd person drive , but they also have my new favorite of helmet cam . there be a head turn effect before turn that occur which i now want in all race game . again , this require some get use to , but holy cow , its fun . the right stick too be use as you head turn function . i use it to look up at the rearview to see all of the racer that i have dust . there be also distortion effect that occur upon impact and those impact affect you whip throughout the remainder of the race , so be cautious and learn you limitation while out there on the course . the game play be extremely rewarding . you do not just race for 1st here . you do not just go for the chedda , although the extra chedda help with upgrade . you do not just go for top on the leader board either . this one throw in some objective to complete on each race . they be useful objective that assist with refining you driving skill . i can not recall all of they , though there be these that i can ; lead a lap , race a clean lap , & master corner \/ racing line . each objective provide you with xp to increase you rank . not sure where the ranking will lead to other than reward at certain rank . anyways here , long review short - i be grateful that the april ps + free-bee include this title . if it do not i would be miss out on a great game ... this opinion after play for only a few hour too . so i guess it have great appeal from the jump off , which will make you want to play more of it . if you do not get it free like i , minus the annual membership fee , you should buy it . well worth the same cost of even the most current nf or gt release . thanks to this opportunity i can see a review for the first shift come soon as well . i 'll be update this as i progress thru the rank . get it if you have not .
620	Video_Games	POS	5	the puzzle be fun to work on , the multi-player mode be really slick and it be so much fun try to figure out how to beat each level . and if that be not enough there be the single player mode . which be a very well develop storyline that you go though . with ton of great voice act that really make it come alive , as well as they attention to detail , often if you wonder to the edge of the map and look off at a odd angle in most game thing just look fuzy like you stare off into space , or thing will look more paint when look further past the main area . but such be not the case here . there be a lot of detail put into every part . it really do bring home the feeling of be in such a place also i love how they also make it seem a few time like you have just about get to the end then thing get change up again , and there be a whole new set of plot to work out . while the whole time have a interesting and challenging set of puzzle to work though that be not just tweak rehash of what you do before but have enough new change to keep you have to think about what to do next .

966	Video_Games	POS	4	musical note : - this review reflect the single player mode of the game only , but if you have 2 microphone or headset you 'll be able to sing duet and access more mode of the game and thus have even more fun playing . you can also use the eyetoy camera to add you face to the game . - the single player mode , though fewer , be still enough to keep you busy and entertain for month while you be try to constantly better you score , unless perhaps you be a very good singer who can get the top score easily , even on the hardest level of difficulty . - for a listing of the 40 song that be include in the game , just click on the amazon forum at the bottom of the first page or read the back of the game box which also list they all . none of the real artist sing they song but the sound-a-likes be pretty good for most of they . as well , i sometimes leave the game on while i be work on my computer , so that it keep play the various song in its demo mode . it be just like have the radio on , play top 40 song . warmup : this be the first ever karaoke game i play , and be very surprised to find myself addict to it after just 30 minute of singing . so much so , that i have to scramble around to find the older version of the game which i also love . although the country version have many boring song with only average male sound-a-like singer , i still like the female sound-a-likes and they song in the game , which be enough to still recommend it , even though i play it the least . i start off with a terrible voice but after many day of practice , i be probably much closer to be a average -lrb- once my voice be warm up -rrb- male singer . no , i still can not remember most of the word to the song until i see they pop up on the screen , but my singing have improve enough to get several diamond record -lrb- highest you can get -rrb- on the easiest of the 4 difficulty level , for some of the easier song like ` piano man ' , ` can not help fall in love ' or ` breakaway ' -lrb- i be surprised they do not have some big hit song like : kelly clarkson 's ` since u be go ' , or james blunt 's ` you be beautiful ' , and once again there be no abba song include , but maybe some of these song will be in the next version -rrb- . even with only 40 song , it be fun to try to better you high score , and if you have all the other 5 karaoke revolution game , you 'll have over 230 song to sing , so repetition be less of a problem . there be also 100 unlockable in this game , include about 24 video -lrb- some fullscreen and some widescreen -rrb- from the american idol tv show . none of the clip be for entire song and generally only run 90 seconds or less , but they do feature kelly clarkson , katherine mcphee , clay aiken , taylor hicks , etc. , -lrb- singing song only from this game -rrb- and sometimes join 4 different singer splice together sing the same song . there be also some funny audition include , like william hung 's ` she bang ' and the wasp guy . it be too bad the singing clip be so short but it be better than nothing . of the 40 song in the game , only 4 need to be unlock and it be easy to do . to unlock ` flying without wings ' , you just need 500,00 total point . to unlock ` piano man ' , earn 4 platinum record . to unlock ` straight up ' earn 6 platinum record . to unlock ` the real thing ' , just get 1.5 million total point in the game . graphic : the cartoony character be basically the same -lrb- if not identical -rrb- as in the previous version and be still nice enough to look at , although until you learn the song melody well enough , you 'll be spend most of you time stare at the pitch arrow and the note tube to see how accurate you pitch be . then of course there be always the lyric to learn , if you want to sound even more authentic . paula abdul be miss from the game , replace by she cheaper but still effective counterpart laura . however , only simon be really necessary anyway . simon and randy look close enough to they real life self and some of the background venue have nice touch , but i think all of they -lrb- other than the american idol stage -rrb- , be in the previous version with sometimes just slightly different thing go on . for instance , here in the beach venue you see a airplane in the background , which have a banner trail behind it which show you name on it and it say , ` happy spring break with -lrb- insert you name -rrb- on the mic . ' ; whereas in kar . rev. party from last year , the plane 's banner say , ' -lrb- insert you name -rrb- will you marry i ? ' , which be much funnier . the central station venue with the subway train go by you be still nice and look basically the same . also , if you sing poorly , you crowd meter go down and you 'll notice there be fewer people in the crowd because people be walk out on you and some will hold they hand over they ear . occasionally , i sing poorly on purpose , just to watch all this and other various thing happen . the various clothing choice be cute , and it be always fun to create a fatso or a skin and bone starlet , and the better you do , the more stuff you 'll unlock . gameplay : just like before , the game grade you on how accurately you pitch match the singer . a on-screen pitch arrow rise or fall as you raise or lower you voice , try to match it up with the note bar that appear on screen . the more you fill you meter up , the higher rating you get for each phrase . string several good or great rating consecutively together for each phrase and you 'll get a combo bonus and also increase the crowd meter and soon double you score . you 'll soon start to glow and the crowd will cheer more . you do not have to sing the word correctly , but if you sing the phrase -lrb- that be sparkling -rrb- well enough -lrb- pitch-wise -rrb- , you 'll also get a crowd boost . if the crowd meter go to the bottom red part for too long , you 'll be boo off the stage before the song even finish . unless you stop singing , or be completely tone deaf , this will never happen to you so do not worry about it . this be basically the same game as the previous version , except with the american idol contest add , that you can play as either a 8 , 13 or 18 round game . it be easy to win on the easy difficulty level . just save the song you be good at -lrb- for the closing round , once you sing a song it be remove from the list and you can not sing it again in the contest -rrb- , till the last 3 round or so and you 'll do fine . for more of a challenge , let the game randomly choose what song you sing in each round or try the harder difficulty level , which will have larger meter to fill , so it be tougher to get `` good '' and `` great '' rating for each phrase . as well , try singing without the note bar or the singer , to see how good you really be . some people think this game be tougher than the previous version of the game , but they all seem about the same to i . in the 18 round american idol contest , only in the first 4 round do the judge decide if you advance . after that , the fan voting come into play . you only hear ryan seacrest 's voice , but never actually see he . nor do you see or hear the other contestant . you just see they name and yours and how many star each of you get for you song . in round 5 , four people be eliminate and 20 stay . then from round 8 onward , only one person be eliminate . after you win there be a dull screen say you be the american idol champion and you also get to sing you encore without be judge of course . also , you can save after each round so you can quit and resume the contest at anytime . also , if you lose , they let you retry the song or pick another one right away . you can even play the american idol quick play mode which let you sing one song and then hear what the judge think of you . you high score will still be save in this mode as well . the problem with the judge be that they sometimes get the fact wrong . once , during a contest , while i have over 20,000 point and singing well enough , the judge be cover they ear and at the end say my pitch be not good and that i should not have sing this song again because it be even worse this time around . not only do i not remember singing that song in the previous 7 round -lrb- although i might have ? -rrb- , but more important , be the fact that i get my highest score and a platinum record for this song which then unlock some stuff . so obviously i sing it better this time -lrb- even if simon be right that i have sing it before ? -rrb- . most of the time however , they get it right and even though they sometimes repeat much of they dialogue , they have enough different variation to keep it interesting and give you a chuckle or too . once you have hear it all , you can always just skip they comment anyway . there be also a medly mode , again , where you can sing part of three , four or five song string together , but since you score be not save in this mode i do not play it much . i suppose you could write down you best score but i be too lazy to bother . i also like use the karaoke mode -lrb- there be no judge -rrb- , with the lyric and note bar set to ` off ' , just to watch and listen to my character sing the song . i usually decide not to sing along in this mode because it be then easier for i to notice all the animation and thus enjoy the graphic and sound-a-like singer even more . some comparisons with the previous version : this game save you high score -lrb- even the date -rrb- and separate they among the different difficulty level you sing they in , and whether or not you sing the long or short version of the song . unfortunately , you song score be list alphabetically by song name , so if you want to see what song you be best at , -lrb- on a specific difficulty level -rrb- , you 'll have to scroll through the entire list of song to compare . however , i prefer the first three karaoke revolution game ' high score listing , because in those one , you score be list from highest to lowest , so it be much faster to see which song you get you highest score on , and which one you need to practice more . although , in the these earlier version , there be no diamond record give for a perfect score , so you never see the word ` perfect combo ' on the screen , while you be singing , to help let you know you be on you way to a perfect 50,000 point score . as well , in the older game when you beat you previous high score it say so on the screen . but in this latest version and last year 's country and party version , it do not . instead , you have to remember you score and then check to see if it be now in the high score section or list as you new best score in one of the song selection screen . sure all you score be still save , but i want to know right after the song if i improve my score . it be no big deal i guess , since the loading in between screen , be very fast , but still i prefer the older way of show thing . this american idol version have no dancing or minigame option that kar . rev. party have , but that be no big deal since it be hard for most people to sing and dance at the same time without lip-synching -lrb- hello , ashlee simpson -rrb- , and the minigame get dull fast . the two basic minigame -lrb- there a extra one if you play with other people -rrb- from kar . rev. party be a okay way to practice singing note , but the game themselves be too basic to be fun for more than a day . another problem be that you score for the minigame be not save , so unless you write they down , you will not know if you improve . if you only want to buy one of these other version , then just pick the one with more of you favorite song in it . however , if you want to be able to sing duet with a friend , do not buy the first one or volume 2 . as well , all of the other version have about 35-37 song in they , except for kar . rev. party , which have 50 song . my so-called singing technique : i use the ps2 konami brand microphone -lrb- which come in this game bundle pack and it have a 15 foot long cord -rrb- , and even after adjust the in-game various setting to change my microphone level , the cpu singer or music volume level , i still find it best to turn on my stereo so i can better hear my voice come through my larger stereo speaker and enjoy the music more . if you do not have you ps2 hook up to you vcr , which be in turn hook up to you stereo system , you be miss out on a bit of the fun factor . however , at night , i sing without the stereo because i do not want to wake anyone up . i still have fun singing either way and can still hear my voice through the regular tv speaker , even with the music and singer set to full or to about two-third of the maximum setting . however , i just recently discover that if i hook up my fairly cheap sony discman head phone to my stereo -lrb- i still use the hand hold microphone for singing -rrb- , i can greatly improve my score . get perfect 50,000 point score -lrb- easy level -rrb- now happen more often for i . it be obviously because i can stay in tune more easily since it be easier to concentrate on the singer 's voice and match it . i do not think use the game 's usb headset microphone would work as well as my regular head phone and hand hold mic . combination because i have hear that the headset microphone be not as good as the hand hold one that come with this game . also , the headset mic . only have one speaker . the other ear only get a piece of plastic , so it would be like listen to the song in mono . since all the song be in wonderful cd quality stereo -lrb- unlike the mono song of singstar pop -rrb- , it would be foolish not to have both ear wire for sound . try use either ear phone or head phone -lrb- with a head phone extension cord if necessary -rrb- like i do and you score should also improve . at first i be sing too loud and screech out the high note too often which give i more of a gravelly voice and i could barely ever hit the low note anymore , so i have to rest my voice and sing softer , till i eventually get my full voice back and be then able to more easily sing a high note and then a low note immediately after . avoid strain you voice by singing softer until you have better command of you voice . be patient . on the easy difficulty level , the phrase meter -lrb- use for point -rrb- be smaller so you can miss many of the note and still score a gold -lrb- 12,500 point -rrb- or platinum record -lrb- 20,00 point -rrb- by quite easily fill this meter often enough , especially if you know or learn the melody of the song . diamond record -lrb- 50,000 point -rrb- be difficult for lame singer like i but it be exciting to see the word `` perfect combo '' on the screen during a song , because i know if i keep get `` great '' rating for each phrase i 'll get that diamond record . just one phrase that be less than the `` great '' rating , end the chance for that coveted diamond record . get the word wrong do not affect you score but you 'll feel more satisfied the more word you get right . summary : this be a great game for lousy singer -lrb- hello,k-fed -rrb- who want to improve to at least a bad or average singing level , and even if you be a already good singer , you can use this game to show off to you friend and even learn some of the lyric to 40 song . of course , this also make a even better party game , but because the game show you how much you unlock and how much of the 100 unlockable be still leave to unlock , you 'll probably have trouble stop yourself from singing . you 'll say to yourself , `` just one more song , and then i 'll go to bed '' or perhaps , `` uggh , i just miss the platinum record by 185 point , i have gotta try one more time ! '' so , do you need this game if you have already play one or more of the previous version but have now lose interest in karaoke ? the answer of course be no. . however , there be a nice mix of song in this version as well , so if you check out the song list in the amazon forum post at the bottom of the first page and if you like some of they , simon say ... `` buy it !!!

38	Video_Games	POS	5	when bungie announce that they be make halo 2 , a lot of people think that they be just fix up the original one and add thing . bungie then inform the public that it be build it all over again and this be much more than just a re-make . the game design and control be identical to the original , while the graphic be bump up a few notch . the texture take a few seconds to load sometimes mid cut-scene , but it be a improvement . you can definately tell the same people design the level in this game that do the last , as there be one or two that be pretty redundant and stretch probably longer than they need to . but overall , this game have many new thing to offer . first off , duel weilding weapon . you can still only store one weapon that you be not use , but the current one , if it be hold by one hand , can leave room for you to pick up another one handed weapon . in this case , you can fire both simultaniously or in whatever combination you want -lrb- alternate and such -rrb- because you right trigger control you right weapon , and leave trigger now control the left one -lrb- as oppose to the grenade , like normal -rrb- . this add much to the game on its own . second , you have a plethora of new weapon to play with . the covenant arsenal have be expand exponentially , and you can now wield the energy sword -lrb- a new favorite , as you could imagine -rrb- . you also get the fuel rod projector , which be the big gun that be graft onto the arm of the hunter - the covenant equivalent to the rocket launcher . it have a covenant equivalent to a sniper rifle , and a carbine also . third , you can hi-jack vehicle . this be a major plus , but definately a skill to be learn and master . this will make multiplayer much more interesting . also , you can climb on enemy tank , pop the cover open , and drop a grenade in there to cook the pilot without waste a rocket like you have to before . fourth , the story be much more complex . there be more cutscene , and another goodie that be leave out of the previous review -lrb- or at least the one i have read -rrb- . while the story do not flow nearly as easily as the last game , there be essentially two story happen simultaneously . i be guess the story will combine later -lrb- i be only halfway through now -rrb- , but beside the one with the master chief , you play the arbitor in the other . you be the disgraced elite that be in charge of the fleet in the first game . you failure to bring the master chief down and preserve the halo have bring you much pain , and the suicidal position of the arbitor . you play alongside the covenant military as he , and run mission against covenant rebel and other thing . this give much exposure into how the covenant work and develop they much more so than the last game . two variation to the original classic weapon must be note . the pistol do not have a scope on it anymore , which will definately balance multiplayer game by limit those head-shot guru who never fight up close . also , the previous assault rifle , with its automatic fire and 60 round magazine be long go . in its place be the battle rifle , with a 2x scope , but only a three round burst fire mode , and a 32 shoot magazine . sadly enough , take elite out with that be much harder because you can not bum-rush they while empty you magazine . the three round burst definetly slow down the effectiveness of the rifle in short range combat , which be probably why they introduce the sub machine gun , which be a high rate of fire , caseless , one handed weapon . of course , now you have to have both of they for the same advantage you have with the single assault rifle before , but it be a minor setback . i do not have access to xbox live where i be at currently , but i be sure this will be one of the greatest live experience to date . i know how much fun the orinigal game be in multiplayer , so this one , with its improvement , will be much better . all in all , the developer have make a game with the same addictive attribute of halo , but with much more replayability , mass multiplayer option , and enough improvement to fill a football stadium . all of the other fpss i have will have to take a backseat to this . there be just nothing that can compete .

227	Video_Games	POS	4	this game be one of the funnest game i ever play konamus co. it be a 3rd person view game that you need alot of stratigie to beat . its challenging and keep u there for hour . however i do have a complaint ... . . as soon as u beat the game on campain u want to play online ... . so i beat it and i want to move foward so i go online and i need to laod a couple of file it take a day and a half to do it and plus my ps3 be go to over heat . then when that be over i play and it be very difficult to play and level up . i think to level up u need to be play for a certain amount of time and not expirence . i think this be stupid cuz u need to stay on for like 15 hour to level up . and also u need to pay for alot of money for extra feature . but wat i thought be cool be u can make ur own guy online and make he look `` pimp '' . but sometimes u need to pay . so i enjoy the campaign not the online . hope u have fun either way ! sorry for miss spelling in a rush peace
310	Video_Games	POS	5	some people obviously have bias opinion regard this game . bottom line be , if you be a fan of platformer or the spongebob show , you will love this game . there be so much humor and great gameplay in here ! if you like play rpg , then you should go be a wizard instead . graphic - 9 , gameplay - 9 , sound - 10 , replayability - 9 . the score say it all .

348	Video_Games	POS	5	awesome seller !!!! fast shipping , cable work great . i be gonna buy from they again !!!!! a + + + + + + + + + +
95	Video_Games	POS	4	this game be awesome and if i would have actually pay full price for it ... it still would have be underprice in my opinion . obviously this be one of those game that if you not into rpg 's you might not like it , but at the same time if you simply new to rpg 's and enjoy fp ' then this be a great game for you to get start with . story : without spoil anything i will just say this . the story be well write and play out very nicely . also the freedom to sort of `` direct '' you conversation and certain action that you take make the replay value of this game fairly high . you can pursue a romantic interest with ally or keep it all professional . you have the chance to win over the loyalty of you teammate but you can fail and some of the situation 's that involve gain ally `` loyalty '' may cause you player reputation to look bad , but you have full control over the path you take . gameplay : it may take some get use to , but it be very easy to learn the control . the player movement be pretty smooth imo and the aus -lrb- you ally -rrb- do a pretty decent job during combat situation . -lrb- some character be better than other but the longer the game go on the more ally you get to choose from -rrb- . overall i give this game a 4\/5 -lrb- really a 4.5 -rrb- instead of a 5 only because the character interaction get a little repetitive after a while . -lrb- during the game while not on a mission you can go talk to various character , but most usually repeat the same thing over and over again until you have complete certain mission -rrb- . would recommend this game to everyone who enjoy a good shooter and the fact that it be rpg make it better since the storyline be so extensive .

201	Video_Games	POS	5	these headphone be awesome ! i go the cheap route at first get a few other like the triton and i have the plantronic gamecom for my pc . i then get the x41 which be pretty close to these , except without the bluetooth , and other advanced feature . a few week later these come out , and i return the x41 's to get these . these headphone have all the feature i be look for . i can play use my xbox or the ps3 . currently on the 360 i have to use the wire headset connector , but they just come out with a bluetooth attachment to you controller that get rid of that cord as well . you can also pair these with you phone and answer phone call without take you headset off . connect : the input connector be with a optical digital signal -lrb- there be also a analog input -rrb- this mean that out of the box you would have to keep switching cord if you want to go back and forth between the 2 . what i do be connect my px5 to the digital optical output from my av receiver -lrb- older harman kardon -rrb- . this allow i to switch input without have to mess with wire . i can also use they to get surround sound from movie and tv show from my set top box . sound quality : when i first connect these i think the sound be still come from the speaker in the room , that be how directional the sound be . i have to take they off to make sure that it be actually the headset produce the sound . i would say these be better than use you surround speaker to play game , since you do not have the ambient noise in the room distract you from the sound of the game . additional feature : there be a interesting voice editor , which allow you to change you voice when chat online . you can change you pitch to sound like like a chipmunk to a necromorph , and whatever you want use the custom editor . make for some fun in a halo post game lobby if you want to mess with the oppose team . summary : these be great to use if you want great sound , and you do not want to distract other around you . yea they be a bit pricey for headphone , but definitely worth it . they be definitely cheaper than get a surround sound setup if you do not already have one .

315	Video_Games	POS	4	i have play this game a fair amount since release and feel i can give a review on my initial impression on the game . it be a mmo so the game will evolve over time , so some of my statement may no longer be relevant after patch be release . pro : + graphics + soloable -lrb- party be still faster -rrb- + in depth , skill base craft system + storyline + music + extremely large zone , you will rarely come across zone line con : - uus lag for npc interaction , change equipment , and craft - no auction house\/market search -lrb- detail below -rrb- - teleport consume anima , you gain enough anima for 1 to 1.5 teleport a day - chat system be clunky , and linkshell -lrb- guild -rrb- chat can easily be lose in battle spam -lrb- you deal x damage to y monster -rrb- . filter be avalible , but not complete . - content lock out currently . ishgard -lrb- the new jeuno for ffxi player -rrb- be close . you can not ride chocobo yet . no airship . this make travel time consuming , and no central place for meeting people . - uus do not improve over xi , pretty much the same -lrb- just more\/different menu option -rrb- . - account management be clunky beyond belief . i would also like to hit on a few point that have people worry before release . the biggest be probably the fatigue system where people be afraid that se would limit you play time . well , i can tell you that unless you be a power leveler -lrb- as in play all day every day -rrb- you will not hit the limit . you can get into the 20 's for rank within a single week , the cap for the game be currently 50 . so if 3 week be too long to reach max level ... then i guess the fatigue system will be a problem for you . for we mortal who must sleep however it be not something you be likely to run into . level pace be extreamly fast for the first 10 rank , once you hit rank 10 however you hit a wall and thing slow down , a lot . i also want to go into more detail on one of my con , the lack of a auction house\/search system . in this game almost all you equipment will come from crafter . not drop . not buy from npc shop . this give crafter in the game a real purpose , and i like that because i enjoy craft . this be completely opposite to game like wow where the vast majority of craft goods be ` useless ' in comparison to dungeon drops\/quest reward . to sell item you can create a npc retainer who act like a shop keeper . you put they in a area that act like a market square where other player can walk around and view each shop . there be no way to search who be sell what , or who be buy what . you have to go through each retainer , one by one , and there be thousand of they . you be look at significant time to search through a sea of stuff you do not want to try and find the item you need ... at a price you can afford . the problem with this be all the craft be dependent on each other . want to make a spear as a blacksmith ? you 'll need a carpenter to make the shaft , and the carpenter will need raw wood from a botanist . you 'll also need some leather for the grip , which you get from a leather worker , who need chemical from a alchemist to cure the hide . you can see how this be go , if you want to make something you need to buy component from other crafter -lrb- or level that craft yourself -rrb- . with no auction house or market search feature it be near impossible to find the item you need , which make craft gear near impossible , which mean once you get into the teens for rank , and certainly into the 20 's , you gear be really start to hurt you . that be my biggest complaint with the game . se have say they have something ready -lrb- either ah or search feature -rrb- but they be wait to see what player do with the economy ... this be really stupid in my opinion as this issue be turn a lot of people away from they game , include i . fix this one issue and my rating of the game will increase a substantial amount . my recommendation would be to wait to purchase this game until they have fix the ah\/market search problem . once that be fix , it really have the potential to be a great mmorpg . -lrb- small note on collector 's edition . the na crowd get shaft big time compare to eu . we get less stuff -lrb- know before purchase -rrb- but also the journal be crap compare to the eu one . -rrb- update 9\/29\/2010 : square-enix have announce plan to re-do the market ward . they 'll name each ward towards specific category of equipment\/items and any item sell in that ward that fall under its category will have a reduce tax . player be not force to sell only that category goods though . they plan to implement this in 1 to 2 week . i can see this improve the situation , but not entirely solve it . since each player be currently limit to a single retainer you can expect the category to only be loosely follow . se plan to allow player to have multiple retainer , but likely at a real world cost of $ 1\/extra retainer -lrb- this price be announce long ago before the game release -rrb- . i will personally probably get 2 extra retainer to make the game cost be $ 14.99 which be equal to other pay to play mmo 's . it should be note that each retainer have a 80 item capacity so the more you have , the more storage you have also . update : 7\/27\/2011 : well , it have be almost a full year -lrb- 10 month -rrb- since launch and i can say this game have see major improvement . it be still not quite there , but it be a much better game than what we first see . the market ward have a nice search feature , that include price . it will even place a icon next to the retainers name so you can easily find they in the ward . shopping be a much much more enjoyable experience now . i still think a ah style in the way of ffxus would be better -lrb- game would not have to load thousand of retaienr - obvious lag -rrb- . combat have have lot of improvement , most recently the removal of fatigue and stamen , and the addition of you time honor auto-attack . since stamen be remove you special skill now work off cool-down timer like you be use to from ffxus and other mmo 's . craft for local levequest be now much faster since it give you a repeat option . no more need to go through you menu every single time . it also remember that last few thing you have craft for quicker access . repair have be greatly simplify , a single material type be now need for every equipment type call dark matter . no more need to carry around , or find , several different type -lrb- for example cloth fent , tree branch , ore , metal , etc -rrb- to keep you armor and weapon in good shape . they have add nm and also have start add quest to the game that fall outside of the basic levequest the game start with . there be still very few of these though . you can tell from the patch note and the letter from the producer that they be put the framework in for questing hub like you 'll find in most popular mmo 's that will be a welcome addition . they have add the hub , but not the quest yet . they have also add two instanced dungeon -lrb- they call they raid , but i think that be a bit much for what they be -rrb- that require party to complete . i have decide to bump my review up a star to 4\/5 due to all they change they have make . the final star can be earn once they flesh out the quest to add content to keep it from be a mindless grindfest to level , and once they finally add alternative mode of transportation -lrb- airship and chocobo at a minimum -rrb- .

949	Video_Games	POS	5	word can not express how incredible this game be ! i want to start this review by come in with a bit of a background on myself . i first get into elder scroll when i hear about skyrim be release in 2011 when it be 2010 . honestly , it look great . so i pick up oblivion because i think that would give i a idea . now many may disagree with i . but i be not too impressed with oblivion . i have some fun , but i be scare a lot from explore , and the main quest with the oblivion gate be terrifying . i put in many 10 hour into that game before i call it quit . so when skyrim first come out . i wait just a bit to hear about . i be then fortunate enough to get it as a christmas gift and even the first scene just blow i away . for return fan , this have -lrb- for i at least -rrb- every aspect of oblivion that i do like , and everything else be near perfection . this game be the most true to a rpg theme than any other . from the start you can truly do whatever you want , whenever you , however you want , as whoever you want . the race create a great mix of culture and dispute , with different benefit and like to you character . the universe be immense and you completely fall into this beautiful world of conflict and distress . the most amazing thing . if you pick up this game , you have just pick up at least 50 hour of entertainment . over the course of 3-4 month . i have play over 100 hour of this game . it be mind blowing . how be a game capable of such a defeat ? the quest be great , and you do not even have to do the main quest if you do not want , and the guild quest will be just as intense and lengthy as the main quest , so you have plenty of fun . every skill be improve base off how you use it . be you into stealth ? sneak around , pick lock and pocket and you will get better as you go . more of a brute ? collect heavy armor and some strong weapon and take the enemy 's head on and become the strongest man\/woman in skyrim . it have a adaptional feature , so it really customize the game to you liking . and you can even build you own weapon and armor with the smithing skill . and for the first time magic be as strong as the other lifestyle . so you can finally live as a mage if you like magic . and learn at a college ! it be phenomenal ! if you a fan of medival castle age or fantasy , you could not ask for a better game . it be simplly perfect . on a scale to 1-10 i would give it a 9.8 and the only reason it be not perfect , be because there be a few bug . i have not experience as many as there supposedly be . but i can not ignore they , and for that reason it be not a perfect ten . but it be as close as one can get . it be a very open world game , and rumor have it that a expansion pack like dlc be to come soon that may even open up the old word of morrowind or cyrodill -lrb- previously release title in the series with a new gen touch -rrb- which i be unbelievably excite for . i can not stress enough how amazing this game be . even if it do not sound like you kind of game because of violence or quest , just try it , and see for yourself , because you want be able to drop it once you try it !

116	Video_Games	POS	5	let i start by say that i be a avid rpg player , in fact it be nearly the only genre of game that i play . by far my favorite sub-genre for rpg be turn-based one . since these be dead on the home console , i jump at the one that still make they way onto the handheld system . enter xseed 's localization of trails in the sky , a jrpg develop by falcom originally for the pc . the first thing many psp rpg gamer will ask be : why would i buy another legend of heroes game when the first three suck so bad ? well here be three reason : 1 -rrb- the game be localized by xseed , not namco bandai . xseed have do a truly fantastic job of translate this game , something namco fail miserably at . 2 -rrb- xseed do not fool around with the game play , something namco also do with the original trilogy . 3 -rrb- this be the first game of a trilogy , and the story contain in this game have absolutely nothing to do with the other three localized by namco . namco also release the last trilogy out of order -lrb- they obviously do not care about the game at all ... -rrb- and xseed be release this trilogy in the proper order ; -rrb- story -lrb- spoiler free -rrb- : so let talk about the game . first and foremost this game be heavily story base , and be not voice act . if you do not like to read a lot of text for story advancement turn away now . the main purpose that i play rpg be for they story , and trail in the sky deliver . it have be a long time since i have be this hook on a rpg story that once i pick the game up i do not put it down until i have too -lrb- food or sleep -rrb- . so far i be a little over 20 hour into the game and just start chapter 2 -lrb- there be 4 chapter plus the prologue -rrb- . gameplay be estimate at 50 hour so you 'll certainly get you money worth . i be very impressed with this story and i can not give enough thanks to xseed for spend so much time do a good translation ! the story do contain some of the jprg cliche but it be not drip with they like some game . i find the interaction amongst the character to be humorous and enjoyable to read . not a single character i have come across yet -lrb- 4 of the 8 -rrb- have cause i to be annoyed and hate they . typically in jrpg there will always be a ultra annoying emo boy and girl that i hate immediately , not so here . this game be part of a trilogy , and like some other rpg you will be able to import you save game into the next game of the series . the game also have a new game + feature where nearly everything be carry over if you wish to play through the game again and try to get any bracer points you miss , or hide item . gameplay : most of the area in the game be at 3rd person overhead view , with the camera rotatable by 360 degree . in some area , notably indoor area the camera will be fix . the game story be linear , however you do have some freedom and plenty of opportunity for exploration . there be place you can visit and explore for good loot that be not party of the story , and will be miss if you do not take advantage of it before the story take you onto different region . for combat people should be happy to know that there be no random encounter ! you can see all random enemy before you engage they . there have be plenty of variety in the enemy you fight , along with several that require different strategy to kill . combat be turn-based , and unlike most turn-based game you can move you character around on the battle field . you may at first think that sound similar to a srpg , but it be really not . you can either move and attack , just move , start cast a spell , use a special attack , use a item , or flee . several spells\/special attack will have area of effect which be show the screen so you 'll know if you can hit multiple enemy . turn order be display on the screen , and randomly up come turn will have bonus assign to they -lrb- 100 % critical , heal some health\/ep\/cp , increase strength , etc -rrb- . it be in you best interest to manipulate the turn-order to gain those bonus . needless to say there be plenty of room for tactic here , but the over all combat system be very easy to understand . you will not be overload with option . sound & graphics : these two category be the lowest in importance to i . that say , i do not have any issue with either . the graphic look good , the text be all perfectly readable , no issue with frame rate or sound stuttering , none of the music annoy i . in combat you character will say thing for some attack -lrb- battle voice -rrb- . i really do not have much to say on this aspect of the game . conclusion -lrb- tldr -rrb- : this be a excellent jrpg that exceed all of my expectation for the game . the story be excellent , the translation be top notch , the character be all likeable , the combat system be enjoyable , and i be happy with the sound and graphic . trail in the sky , you get 5 star from i ! update -lrb- 7\/26\/2011 -rrb- : i have since complete the entire game , along with all quest . total play time be 51 hour . that time be with very , very little grind of any kind . i do a little at the start of the game -lrb- maybe a hour or two -rrb- but none after that . my opinion of the game have not change either . i still feel like this be a excellent game and i will definitely be buy the sequel when it arrive . the game of course end on a cliff hanger -lrb- it be a three part game i believe -rrb- and i actually be slightly surprise by the plot twist .

898	Video_Games	POS	5	i want to play halo 3 use a ps3 controller - that be i . i have countless hour log play fps game on ps3 like mag and be not try to re-learn how to walk on my 360 . plus i find the 360 controller uncomfortable , it cramp my finger and that creep into my neck . ok , so the version i get be obviously open-box , it come in a plastic bag mark `` make in china '' . usually , this would cost a star on my review , but i do love this gizmo . here be the rule : have everything set up with this device before you turn the 360 on . use a sony brand ps2 controller and a m brand wire 360 controller -lrb- not a `` plug in '' wireless controller -rrb- . turn rumble off through the 360 dashboard . if this do not work , return the item for a replacement , and if that do not work , post in you review which 360 you be use so people can figure out what work and what do not . i be use a old white 20 gig 360 . btw , this also work on a pc - i be able to get it to work with some emulator .

162	Video_Games	POS	4	well this be a amazing game and this be come from a guy who have never be a fan of rpg\/medieval fantasy game . maybe my interest change and i do not know it ? this be also a reedit review base on the performance issue that have plague the ps3 version almost exclusively . i be 30 hour into the game and i be start to slowly witness more of the issue they talk about and some not talk about . not everyone have suffer the issue on ps3 which be odd because it be most likely due to a structural issue with the ps3 . -lrb- ... -rrb- however , these be unofficial opinion base on someone who work on fallout : new vegas , a similar open world game and sequel to bethesdas fallout 3 . skyrim and new vegas have different game developer , but be both publish by bethesda . nevertheless , i think the guy be probably correct . if you do not read the article , it basically say that the ps3 only have 256 mb of ram devoted separately to both graphic and memory . why be this important ? answer : xbox 360 -lrb- pc -rrb- have the same amount -lrb- or more for pc -rrb- , 512 mb , but the xbox ram be universal . thus , it can devote more ram towards one or the other base on the game need . as you advance more in the ps3 game , you save file get bigger -lrb- from all the thing you have collect , drop , kill guy , all the stuff you move around throughout the game grow -rrb- while have less ram to work with . this be probably whats cause all the problem , although it be interesting to note that some ps3 user have report no issue . maybe they do not care ? its probably safe to assume that with a game this size , there be numerous factor at work . however , we know there be issue . i be hope i would be one to avoid these but i be start to see more freeze and game glitch as i reach the infamous 6 mb save file of which i be almost there -lrb- this be where a lot of people have start see issue -rrb- . the most outrageous glitch i have have -lrb- and one i have not read other people have -rrb- be when i be fight a dragon and be kill without good reason . during the battle , my body simply shoot upwards in the air and die instantly . i reload and try the battle again and the same thing happen . the thanksgiving patch also supposedly may make the game worse which they say would do the opposite . honestly , as of right now , i be quite worried . i see another video where either ign or another company be play the game and it be suffer from frequent lag . i can not take it back to gamestop so i be stick with my version . sadly , i find out after i already buy the game that my friend wife -lrb- who have the same computer as i -rrb- can run the game fine . ouch . i now feel dissapointed at what be once start out a amazing game experience . now , i have to worry about crippling issue down the road . i would have personally be fine -lrb- i be sure many other would to -rrb- to have the game be delay for ps3 and do correctly , if possible . besides all the issue , the game be a blast . no need to go over what you have already hear . its a open world adventure that keep get more interesting as you go along and play at you own speed . but the issue be there . for now , it be not like it freeze every 10 minute , but i be worry about future lag . the game have probably freeze about 4-5 time in the 30 hour span . plus some glitch , occasional short lag in open area , and the before mention super dragon glitch that happen twice . all in all , not enough to ruin it so far . that be say , i hope people take everything i have say into account . i do not mean to focus entirely on the negative aspect , but i think they should be address more thoroughly because everyone know about the awesome gameplay etc. . and you i encourage you to read the article and do as much research as you can before buy this game . you will have to decide you own tolerance for glitch .

621	Video_Games	POS	4	the good : aaa genesis title , perfect emulation , save anywhere feature make play more fun and easier , wireless be great , addition of info and hint be interesting and helpful the bad : games do not have any upgrade , a few dud the genesis be the first system i ever own or play so these title and compilation be right up my alley . with the best genesis ever make in one game be great . games from sonic the hedgehog 2 to ristar to vectorman . what be best about this be not just the game but the layout and feature . most game feature wireless multiplayer and the ability to swap score . also , each game have a museum feature to view box shot , hint , info , and thing about these game you never know . the menu be nice and easy and loading be almost non existent . the best part about this be the save anywhere feature . you save in a spot you load in that spot ... as easy as that . there be no upgrade to the game at all which be a bit of a disappointment since there be many problem with the game . other than that pick this up and you will love it !

262	Video_Games	POS	4	i 'll start off by say that the game have a number of improvement over fable ii - but some thing that be specifically address just do not seem to have \* really \* be fix . as the title state - i do not really understand why female hero have to be so incredibly large . it be really out of place , and peter molyneux specifically say that in this game we would not look like `` slightly different look man '' . make no mistake , we still do , and at the start there be even a cross-dressing quest so i do not really think he take the complaint seriously . you will still grow taller and generally larger than everyone , and you will still look manly in 90 % of the outfit in the game . the second thing i do not like be this hand-holding business . it seem like there be just \* too much \* of it . it be cute once or twice in appropriate situation -lrb- like lead a child home -rrb- , but it be get to the point where it be just creepy in some of the quest . it be gimmicky , and while it be a interesting dynamic i just feel it be overuse and not necessary -lrb- like when you be escort a grown man you be not in a relationship with through a tunnel or to another town ... -rrb- the sanctuary take the place of the standard rpg-style menu be incredibly innovative and actually responsive . i have concern when they be first talk about it , but it load immediately and i have yet to lock up while visit any of the room . i sometimes miss the menu , but i think that be just the old school rpg ` er in i . relationships be slightly more interesting -lrb- and there be some better-looking people now too -rrb- - with folk actually send you on fetch-style quest before take next step . it be a little more realistic , but it be not really what i be hope for -lrb- a relationship that grow over time rather than a few emote , a fast travel trip to another town and a cheap ring -rrb- . the interaction seem to be limit to one on one , which be a improvement over the last game . it be sometimes annoying to be court one person , and end up with the entire town in love with you . they should have keep the old style of selecting which emote to use as well - one can only take so much pat-a-cake before gouge one 's eye out ... jobs be still here , and this time they actually take a little more hand-eye coordination than just mash the a button at a certain time . you progress in job be link directly to the storyline - and honestly i do not really care much for that either . too much be tie to the storyline - you will have to progress to a certain point before you can start do the side thing like buy business and make more money at job . i see what they be try to do , but it feel a little too linear and less open than the last game . i feel like i have to do the story , and to be quite honest i be not really feel it . peter must be daft if he think the last story be somehow more forgettable than this one . at least the last one be not such a tired and stale `` tyrant oppress the people hero rise to overthrow tyrant '' standard . fable ii 's story i actually think be interesting and original , and certainly more think out than this one . they do reuse a lot of the voice act from the previous game . i do not know if it be intentional to give the long time fan a sense of familiarity or if it be just laziness , but it be there and i think it be worth mention . the other thing i will mention regard the voice acting be the script be a lot funnier . fable ii be funny , but this game be even better in that respect . i literally spit out drink on some of the butler 's quip in the sanctuary -lrb- like when approach the mannequin naked or leave while in a chicken suit -rrb- . it make the lack of a original and interesting story all the more lamentable . all in all , it be still a fun game to play if you enjoy the fable series , but they regress in enough place that i can not in good conscience give this game a full five star rating . four star be a good rating -lrb- and maybe even too generous -rrb- - lot of great stuff in this game , but some area where they still need to improve .
648	Video_Games	POS	5	cool game with fun combat . you control which direction you swing\/block in by move the mouse . you can play single player and raise a army , or multiplayer and test you medieval combat skill against other . multiplayer game in this can get large , large public game be around 100 people . i have be in some private one where you march in formation and fight with musket with 250 player . generally you either play siege , one team attack , and one defend a castle , both team 's player respawn on death . or you play battle , which be you bread and butter one life per round team combat . even once you be tire of `` native '' there be lot of mod to choose from that will change the game , and give it a new breath of life .

374	Video_Games	POS	5	the ability to play all three god of war game on one system for anyone who one a ps3 be great . the fact they go the extra mile and polish both game slightly for the better hardware of the ps3 be even better . the improvement be so good that you will really notice it during the cut scene , which be not polish ' . its odd to have cut scene in a game that be less polished than the actual gameplay , but in a good way . and put both game onto one disc be the way to go . if you have already play through the first two and have the ps2 still hook up there be no real need to buy the collection . but if you be excite about god of war 3 and never play the first two , this be about the best deal around . two game for under $ 40 and it can sometimes be find for even less . a great value for two of the greatest platform action game ever . hopefully it will be enough to keep everyone from count the seconds until god of war 3 's release .
767	Video_Games	POS	5	this game be one my favorite . the graphic and detail be good and quite entertaining . it seem that the game be innitially create with younger people in mind , but i be 22 and i enjoy play . it start out easier at the begin like most game and gradually get more challenging as you work up the higher level . there be some level which still kick my butt -- i be ashamed to admit . what i like about it be there be a lot of free range adventure where spyro be able to roam about seek out hidden treasure and place . not everything you look for be readily obvious . i would recommend this game for anybody who like adventure and level type fantasy game without all the blood and gut . it be also a really great game for kid as there be no profanity or anything of the like involve .
682	Video_Games	POS	5	basically if you like the classic rpg from the ne , sne , ps1 day you should be able to find some value here . persona game be way ahead of they time . persona 1 fan do not even need to hesitate ! buy it ! if you be younger and never know those day , you will have a very rough time deal with the oldschool design convention . if you come into the series at persona 3 it may be a rough transition for you .
723	Video_Games	POS	4	this be unique and fun . it be not a fast paced game but rather one that you can sit and ponder over - which be what make it both entertaining and relaxing at the same time . the graphic be sort of basic so do not expect any visual treat and despite what a previous reviewer have to say i find the music repetitious and bothersome . fortunately there be a option to turn it off while keep the audio game effect on . these be minimal issue since the game deliver when it come to a good puzzle - and that , after all , be the point . probably the only thing i would truly change be the fact that movement within the game be slow - transport from room to room be accompany by a unimpressive visual effect that take a boring several seconds while the player watch this repetitive scene each time they conduct the move . all this aside , for puzzle fan , this be a winner .
747	Video_Games	POS	5	the wii be a great electronic device that help the family play together . unlike other console -lrb- we love those too -rrb- , the wii encourage player to stand up and move . we have a house rule , while play the wii , everyone have to stand up . the handheld remote work well from any position , seat , lay down , etc. , but the fun be in the motion . there be a variety of software game available . we especially love the sport because it reinforce healthy competition with each other . i really do not think we 'll ever get tire of it .

762	Video_Games	POS	4	try to control the plane with you computer keyboard can be very difficult . other than that the game be totally awesome . all though i think they make the flight control a little more flimsy which can account for make it hard to control some of the plane in the game . even with these setback , i love microsoft flight sim 2004 . the detail be more realistic than other version of the flight simulator . i take off from the salt lake city international airport and actually manage to land a 737 on the landing strip in las vegas . the 737 be my favorite plane because once you up in the air , you can put the plane into autopilot and sit to enjoy the view . have read the flight manual for the boeing 737 , i can say that all the control be right where they suppose to on the plane . i also like to set the weather to thunderstorm . i find it more interesting to see lighting storm go on under i when i be 35,000 foot up ! if you look into take fly lesson this game will defiantly reminder you , there be a lot more to fly than just get the plane up in the air . flight simulator 2004 will give you a sure opportunity to fine tune you fly skill .

494	Video_Games	POS	5	remarkable as it be , naughty dog have not have a single game that one would call `` terrible '' . while some be consider more worthwhile then other , they track record be pretty impressive . with the release of uncharted : drake 's fortune , the team develop a beautiful and fun if a tad derivative game that help encourage the more `` cinematic '' approach to game design . then enter uncharted 2 : among thief . practically a seminal milestone in gaming , beat the game and run into somebody who have not play it yet prompt a `` oh man , you have gotta play it ! '' reaction . stunning graphic with believable motion capture , excellent voice act with some truly stellar set-piece , i would almost go and say uncharted 2 nary have a single fault in its narrative -lrb- other than blue cat people but i digress -rrb- . which make walk into the 3rd game , drake 's deception , kind of a tricky situation i be sure not only for fan but for the team . will they try to outdo everything the 2nd game do ? can you really outperform `` perfection '' ? well uncharted 3 be kind of in the middle : it do nearly everything the 2nd game do but better and yet can still leave one with a feeling of deja vu , albeit a impressive deja vu . 2 year after the event of among thief , the game open with drake and sully attempt to solve a riddle from one of sir francis drake 's voyage , a voyage believe to end with the city of ubar , the iram of the pillars or the `` atlantis of the sands '' . drake globetrot from the london underground to a chateau in france to the arabian desert as he search for this mystical city , all the while friend around they be question why be it that he always pursue reckless endeavor for treasure and do not see how it affect he friend and love one . the leap from the first game to the second be pretty extraordinary and not just on a graphical front . the seamless transition of cinematic , gameplay and even event that would have likely be quicktime event or non-interactive be something to behold . that leap to this game be not as grand a leap since now we pretty much know what naughty dog be capable of and while what you be see will not have the `` oh my god , how do they even do this ? '' reaction , it be still mighty impressive stuff . a ship capsizing , a burning chateau and a plane get rip apart ... with you in it be set-piece that really make uncharted 3 one of the more visceral and entertaining blockbuster ride of 2011 . although one could think the team just put these moment in there know people would look for they so they build excuse in the story to have they , you can not deny these be magnificent part of the game . however , for a game highly dependent on a script and precise order of event , it be very disheartening when you end up die because you do not turn a corner fast enough or miss a jump or do not know what way to go during a chase sequence . it make for a odd dichotomy since to further the `` it be like a movie '' feel of a uncharted game , one must rarely die to preserve its flow and yet without prior knowledge of what exactly need to be do , it can make for a very start\/stop kind of structure . also oddly out of place be that unlike the near flawless pacing of among thief , it be very bizarre to say some part in drake 's deception just flat out ... , well they kind of suck . a syrian fortress and a slow beginning as well as certain story element that be never address or properly resolve make i think the game be rewrite a couple of time and certain part get lose in the shuffle . that still do not mean the game do not have incredible high -lrb- see precede paragraph -rrb- but the low be strangely very low . also , the amount of punishment drake take be kind of ridiculous . how can a guy go this long without crack a rib , break he finger or he leg . i mean seriously , dude 's like x-man 's colossus . hell , even the going-on 60 sully can keep up with the youthful drake . but still , if there be one thing you can not knock the team for be presentation and this game be a stunner . other than one wonky wall texture , everything in the game from the mo-cap to the environment and of course the set-piece , uncharted 3 practically bleed production value . voice act as usual be strong and character be appropriately endearing or love-to-hate-them -lrb- but why do elena and chloe look worse than before ? must be the eye -rrb- . the environment be also incredibly gorgeous , whether they be be destroy or not , and some i be sure be incredibly difficult to pull off despite the look of the scene . if there be one thing that uncharted 3 occasionally but not always handle be in the combat which can be strangely frustrating at time . some of they just drag for too long and even though stealth be encourage , be catch do not mean about 10 or so guy , it become a long protracted and tedious firefight as enemy spawn with sniper , grenade launcher and rpg 's lead to many out-of-the-blue death . and this be a common issue among they forum but the aim feel ... off which be quite noticeable when i actually replay among thief before i get this to re-accustom myself to uncharted 's gameplay . this also can lead to the `` start\/stop '' structure i mention before where i can really imagine specific sequence annoying gamer on higher difficulty know what a trial they be even on normal . bring back from uncharted 2 be the online mode , the co-op and the multiplayer . in the co-op , it break down into 3 group : arena , which play out similarly to horde mode with the twist be that every wave will have a specific objective such as kill only count when stand in a area or `` gold rush '' which be straight up capture the flag . there be co-op adventure which have you and 2 player -lrb- with strangely downgrade graphic on the character model -rrb- go through a little mini-story that be about half hour long or so . then there be the new mode , co-op hunter which have 2 team of 2 compete to capture treasure with the villain side gain some computer ai buddy for assistance . since all money\/xp accumulate go towards you online profile , you can jump into co-op or the actual online to better you character 's unlock . and the actual multiplayer of uncharted be indeed kind of a blast . the same basic rule apply : 5 versus 5 , jump and climb anywhere you want while you attempt to capture treasure or just straight tdm , free for all , hardcore -lrb- no weapon mod or medal kickback -rrb- . some new element be introduce such as medal kickback which function but do not become acquire the same way as killstreak . choose one kickback , once a certain amount of medal be obtain , press up on the d-pad activate a certain ability such as instantly spawn a rpg in-hand , run faster for a brief time as well as many other . booster -lrb- or essentially perk -rrb- return while weapon mod be add so you can customize a gun to have faster reload , bigger clip or a `` call out '' which highlight enemy name when they be be aim at so other player can know where they be . also a new element be what be call `` power play '' so say the lose team be lose by ... a lot , a power play be bring in to hopefully give that team a chance to catch up . one thing to note be that the game do have a online pass which do not include a trial mode to test out the multiplayer so if you be rent the game and you want to test the online and see whether you would rather buy this then the other big online game out , you be sol . buy it brand new or pay 10 more buck . remarkable and highly impressive with the occasional blemish , uncharted 3 be indeed a great game . the thrill be more impressive albeit familiar but unfortunately this game come after a even better one and while this game i would recommend someone play without hesitation , it be not the flawless roller-coaster ride as its predecessor .

771	Video_Games	POS	5	nintendo . when you hear the word you automatically think of videogame . why be that you may ask , because the rock the industry in the 80 's and 90 's take down all competition that stand in the way -lrb- atarus , nec , sega , neogeo , panasonic etc -rrb- why be it that none of those company produce videogame system no more , because of the software they have , there target market and the fact they couldnt be trust like nintendo . now onto today issue , why choose a gamecube ? well let see there 1st party game be all classic and the newer title from there second party be unbelievable . need some example well let start with zelda , the best rpg to date for about 17 year this game have be go strong , just get better , next we have metroid prime which have the best graphic of any game for any system . they we have we best friend mario in mario sunshine , along with he brother luigi in luigis mansion . then we have mario party , super smash brother , waverace , pikmin , eternal darkness , animal cross , mickey mouse in magical mirror , nba courtside . in that group alone metroid prime win game of the year in america and zelda win game of the year in japan . so this be the ultimate gaming machine when it come to game . as for adult title that isue be now dead , nintendo have so many now , resident evil 0,1,2,3,4 , eternal darkness , dead to rights , die hard , and bmx xxx which contain nudity and yet the ps2 which supposedly have all adult game take out the nudity . hmmm real adult sony . as for the system itself it come in three color as of right now , other color that may come out be orange , magenta , and gold which show we nintendo likes to give we option to express ourselves and match we room a appliance . the controller be by far better fitting and more responsive than the ps2 and x box one and yea i know this cause i have use all three , it have about 200 game so far , not as big as ps2 but ps2 have be out a year earlier then the cube , and x box have a pitifull showing of game so far . as for add on you have a broadband and dial up modem , for use with phantasy star so far , you can hook up you game boy advance to the cube to swap information or use the gba as a controller , and finally they be make the game boy advance player which hook up to the bottom of the cube so you can play all you gameboy game on tv , so now you have over a thousand game to choose from , much larger than sony . the system use minus dvd to stop pirate company from bootleg nintendo software , which be good so that nintendo can keep there price low on game . this system do not play dvd and that a good thing cause you be buy a vidogame system not a dvd player . and finally the cost of the system be 150 buck as compare to the competitior at 200 . also nintendo be the first company to produce a actuall wireless controller that work call the wavebird , which be a must have , this thing work throw wall and the battery last over 100 hour . above all else why this system , its simple really a huge variety of game for child a adult as compare to the competitor who focus only on adult , as well as a company we all grow up on and that we can trust , and as for the future of game , you have metroid prime 2 , kirby air ride , mario golf , mario tennis , too human , animal crosing 2 , pikmin2 another zelda and the game that will rock the world mario kart . so go get one now , and as for all the other fanboy for the other system , nintendo sales be up , the mature game be here now , most people dont care about online games so you can shove that garbage , sonys titles and microsofts be horrible as compared to nintendo titles so give up the trash talk . when u hear of ps2 all you hear about be well we get gta3 and vice city , well congrat to you , you have 2 good game . and microsoft all you hear be we have halo , and halo 2 be come soon , well congrat to you and you 2 game . metroid prime destroy halo and gta vice city in the graphic and gameplay department , and prime 2 will destroy halo 2 and anything else sony can get exclusive for they . wow i destroy all 4 of there good game with 2 good game , i should use the rest to crush you heart like resident evil 0 , and one graphic which annihalate x box graphic and wait until part4 be out then what will be the excuse and ps2 have no good game to even compare those game too , not even devil may cry . so in close nintendo own this industry hand down .

724	Video_Games	POS	4	like the title say , this game be very overrated . win lot 's of award and such , and be hold ` the best resident evil ever ' i highly disagree . yes , compare to the previous release , this game be much more fast paced , but game of the year worthy ? not really . gameplay : very fast pace , you should not be stick in any area , the puzzle be too simple to be consider ` mind numb ' and you visit most area of the game only once . backtrack have always be a staple in the previous game . storyline : this be probably 4 's weakest area . the storyline be much too james bondish , and or not resident evilish . apperantly the people who title this a great story , have not play any of the other title . the plotline be almost embarassingly simple . almost no twist , or change . kind of a letdown . graphic : a lot of people disagree , but i think the graphic be better in re0 , and the remake . the graphic in this release almost look ` cartoonish ' the color 's could have be do better . music : meh , some song be really good , but most song do not stick with you . i think the end credit theme title ` sorrow ' be very beautiful , in the resident evil sense of course . controls : very good . the same as the previous gamecube release . should not take long at all to adapt . in a way , i sometimes wish this game flop , just so capcom would not stick with make the same game over and over . the previous game always have variety from one another , but capcom decide to make re4 the new base of all future title . this will most definitely appeal to most , but for people who have be into the series since the late 90 's ` like i ' find this to be a very dumb decision . but hey , be not all company 's about ` milk ' what win ? more about the actual game . the enemy be , well , definitely not possible . what in the heck spawn el gigante ? who of which look like a troll from lotr ` yuck ' most enemy in the previous game have similarity to they non-infected counterpart . this game be very weak in the way of tell you what cause such mutation . and ashley graham ? let just say you 'll stop bash sherry after you play a while with that busty blonde . this game be worth get if you want a long , challenging game . but if you be familier with the older title , do not expect this to be anything that make the other game so great . good luck .
469	Video_Games	POS	5	we purchase epic mickey for we 10 year old son for christmas . he be a avid gamer and have play through almost all of the mario game , as well as a few link game , so we be very surprised to see we son have such a difficult time with the game . the reason why he be have a hard time with it be not because it be difficult to control - on the contrary , it be very easy . it be because it be the type of game where you really need to take you time . epic mickey be not a `` rush through and finish it out to win it '' game , but be , rather , truly a epic adventure . you get to be mickey in a entirely new -lrb- or old , depend on how you look at it -rrb- world , where he need not only to save himself , but to help many other . the game change depend on how you play it . if you help out a lot of people , for instance , they 'll be there to lend you a hand when you may need it . or you can skip help other and can just rush through the game yourself , but if you do this the game be a bit more difficult . pro - the control . you get to run around and paint and thin thing . how much fun be that ? grant you can not paint or thin everything , but there be a large number of thing that you can paint and thin , and what you choose to do change the way the land around you look , truly personalize the game . - the sheer size of it . it be huge . it be a game where you can run all over the place and still not see everything , much like disney world itself . - the sentiment . we just get back from disney and see some of the same thing , like `` mean '' street and the disney statue , be so sentimental for i . and watch mickey 's animated face when he see walt 's statue - priceless ! con - the camera control - you do not have full , complete camera control like you do in some game , and i can see where that would be frustrate to some people . to i , however , it be just another challenge to the game , and it do not bother i too badly . epic mickey be a great game - not the easiest game , but definitely great . it actually get emotion out of i whenever one of the character be unremembered by mickey , and when they talk about be forget about by the world . any video game that can not only challenge you and intrigue you , but also make you feel emotion , be a good one to i .
279	Video_Games	POS	4	i be sure that other have cover the basic mechanic by now , so i 'll spare anyone who read my opinion from have to read they again . this be also spoiler free . combat : this be the high point of the game for i . it be be a very long time since i play a handheld rpg that the dev team actually go out of they way to make combat more than a tedious chore . the turn\/grid base strategy combat system be so fun for i i actually go out of my way to change up my team to try out new thing . not that there be not a `` golden team '' that be more powerful than other in a majority of situation , like most rpg with multiple party member , but there be no character that be terrible enough to bench permanently . one of the best part about combat be that if you do not feel like fight you can skip every single non-boss encounter in the game by stunning , run and dodge . and if you be good enough at the combat mechanic the lack of level will not hurt you progression . i love it when a game let 's i make decision on what be fun at the time , rather than force i to slog through whatever be not . another nice thing be that you can go back in time to any fight you want and try it again with a different set up just for fun without have to restart the entire game to do so . i wish more game would allow this . story : personally , the story start out interesting but quickly sink into stereotypical theme . it might be fresh for someone who have not play a lot of jrpg , but if you have i would be very surprised if you be unable to guess every single plot twist come from a mile away . the foreshadowing be so constant that i find myself wish the writer would just present the twist already and spare i another crappy moment of `` oh it could not be this thing that it be '' . i also do not like the fact that some bit of the plot come out of nowhere , seemingly write in at the last second to cover a generic rpg trope . no offense to those who find the same old stuff find in countless other games\/books\/movies comforting . it be just not my thing . the time travel via node system seem pretty exciting at first , but that fade away quickly when i realize that the story be still linear . at certain point you will be ask to make one of two choice . sometimes it will not be obvious that one trivial decision will lead to certain doom , but it will . and after you have make this decision it be game over , back to the start of the chapter , press start to skip , go back to historia to select the right node , etc. . player be encourage to view every bad end with the promise of a special ending , but as it be with the rest of the story it be easy to guess what change by simply view the normal ending and have basic knowledge of usual rpg plot twist . i honestly feel like i waste my time on it and wish i have cheat by use a list to save myself the effort . my main complaint about the story be that this game have the illusion of choice without actually have any to make , because there be always just one right decision . a.k.a. the `` true history '' as it be explain on the back of the box . i prefer to be give choice . music\/graphics : because the review would not be complete without it . the music be pretty nice and the piano version on the cd , if you be able to pick up a game from the original print run , be very pretty . i also like the sprite quite a bit , but that be just my taste . i can see someone who prefer 3d not like it , but say the graphic be terrible just because the art be 2d be silly . overall i like the gameplay quite a bit . if you like fun combat , or even the choice of run away , i would recommend it . however , if you play rpg for the story and be look for something new and interesting it might be better to pick this one up use .

'' the puzzle be pretty easy , but there be a lot of they ! why on earth i have to make my way past three level of quiz just to get to a place i have already see , i 'll never know . the only challenging one , i find , be those idiotic audio narration , which be a bit too hard , see as everyone in my family confirm that they be seven when they be really one . they scaryness of this game be limit . very limit . the only time i even get anything close to scared -lrb- i be only 12 when i play the game -rrb- be : 1 . when one of the npc 's fall down a long flight of stair and be knock unconcious , result in amnesia and a very long hospital stay . i be very attach to this character , and , be the sap that i be , start cry when i hear he fall down the temple step and then see he on the ground . 2 . the end . i think hus be try to outshine themselves . either that , or they be try to make up for the boring-ness of the rest of the game . if you can not stomach be trap in a airless space with a half-rotted corpse , you would best have a partner with you to finish the game for you . that be what i do ! other than that , there be really nothing else of importance about this game i probably should mention other than the fact that it be long , boring , take i 3 year to finish because i keep stop and start , and feel like a field trip . most of the npc 's be very annoying -lrb- i keep want to smack this one ` pillowhead ' ... if you have play the game , you 'll know who i be talk about ! if he offer i a stale cookie one more time ... -rrb- anyway , if you love history , you 'll love this game . if you do not ... well ... it be up to you to decide if you want to put yourself through hour of pointless puzzle .

996	Video_Games	POS	5	i have never play any of the previous uncharted game in this series before . so uncharted 3 be my first encounter in the series . i rent the game free due to a major rental chain 's promotion , and finish it within that time frame . i really like it and i go out a buy a copy so i can play it again later . this be a great game , right from the begin it have i hook with the character and the story . one major complain about this game from other who -lrb- mostly critic -rrb- have play those previous entry in the series , be that they be mostly alike in term of gameplay . but due to the fact that i have never play any other uncharted game before , it be a fresh experience to i , and interesting enough i think it work out well and be a major factor to how much i enjoy it . the graphic - be beautiful in this game , i especially like any sequence that show the arabic sandy environment and that be include the game menu of course lol , character model and texture be impressive . the audio - and i want to say particularly the soundtrack give you a sense of grandeur , at the same time not over the top , and there be no dull moment , all in all the soundtrack make the whole experience very enjoyable , i have to give it to naughty dog , the sound design in this game alone bump the game production value up several level , it be like watch a movie , whether that be a good thing or not . the gameplay - be just about right . before get the game i be worry about there be not much to do in this game gameplay wise , i.e. i be worry too much qte , not enough thing to do with the character , because all the game press review inevitably complain about this one way or the other . but have play it myself , it really be not a issue , in fact , the very first time drake get in the fight i be so pump up by all the action that be go , just the way nd implement the whole mechanism be perfect , i be hooked immediately . i do not know if there be a demo for this game on psn , but i think in order to judge whether the gameplay style be for you , you just need to try it out yourself . the story - be very good , there be good character personality , development , and surprisingly good act from the voice actor , witty comment and stuff really make these character come to life . i really like this aspect of the game , a definite highlight . as i state above , after the free rental , i buy the game lol , and i buy uncharted 2 , and finish that as well . i do not regret for the fact that i do not finish they in release order , i can definitely say if you play uncharted 2 before , uncharted 3 will play similar , uncharted 3 be just a more refine experience w \/ slight change to gameplay , and i can definitely see where the complain be from , because personally even though i like uncharted 2 , i do not enjoy it as much as i do for uncharted 3 , and maybe i be in minority here , but i be so glad i do not play they in order , because i ruin uncharted 2 experience instead of uncharted 3 , i just like the location that drake venture in 3 instead of 2 , -lrb- spoiler -rrb- i just like all the sandy color palette instead of the jungle theme in 2 . -lrb- \/ spoiler -rrb- and i must say you do not have to play they in order , the story in 3 itself stand alone very well , and all the character -lrb- the major one -rrb- have sufficient introduction on they own , so you do not feel the two previous title be pre-requisite in any sort of way , ok , maybe i hear you will miss some joke every now and then , but for i , still great . however the write in 2 be still worth it to play it at least once . all in all , i highly recommend this game , it be certainly a very well design game in every aspect , the production value on this game be impressively high . game play itself be pretty linear , it be no dark doul , but it be not a title you want to miss and you should experience at least once . a top 3 game for i from 2011 , naughty dog i salute you .

235	Video_Games	POS	4	overall i like it . the right knob where you can adjust the tension help a lot in aim . i also like how the tension reduce the likely hood of you push down to hard and then melee or crouch if play call of duty . i do not like how the trigger be place so close to the right bumper as well as the shape of the trigger , both of which make you push the right bumper accidentally to much . i also think you could remap all the button , but it be just the two new bumper . another advantage this controller be how the color button be easier to push .

548	Video_Games	POS	5	so , i be kind of a noob on own a ps3 . in fact , i have not own a console since the original nintendo , but i do get a ps3 to play blu-ray and basically for modern warfare 2 . now i be hardcore into black op and get interested in rpg with the release of the goty edition of fallout 3 . castlevania be new ground for i . i remember the original quite well , but hear that this one be not in keep with the franchise ... a reinvention , as it be . i have no idea that there be story line in the original castlevanias back on the the old bit system , so the story line of this one be so far pretty awesome for i . i be only on chapter 4 -lrb- chapter 2 be nine level ! -rrb- , so i be not all that deep into it , but it be solid as far as game story go . some of it be contrived or seem a little non-sequitur , but hey , it be a video game . it be kind of awesome to listen to patrick stewart orate from a scroll at the beginning of each level , too . gameplay itself be sweet , too . gabriel start off pretty standard with he cross-chain and that be that , but as he develop skill and acquire relic , he get more and more awesome as far as combat . i especially like be able to ride some of the beast , which you have to do in some case to beat certain level . replay value be incorporate into the game since you can replay any level in order to obtain goody use new skill that you could not previously get . also , each level have a trial that you unlock after beat it , so you can play through again and attempt to succeed at a specific task ; some be easy and some be very difficult . this be a cool feature since gabriel acquire skill by buy they with xp , so if you be a perfectionist\/completist like i , you 'll be play through the first level before you be even halfway do the game -lrb- which be why i be only at the end of chapter 4 now -rrb- . graphic and animation and all that picture quality mumbo-jumbo be mind-blowing . the game itself be very , very pretty - and from my perspective , for what it be worth , very polished and not at all glitchy . the worst thing i have notice be when i die and the game freeze frame the moment and put it on `` parchment '' paper to immortalize the moment , sometimes the bad guy who nail i be a little jumpy in place . not really a issue at all . to conclude , this game really have it all : action , puzzle-solving , a bit of exploration , character-building , etc. . if you walk back into castlevania like i do , expect nothing and know nothing , then you will definitely be impress with the stride this franchise have make since the late-1980 's . i highly recommend this game !
890	Video_Games	POS	4	overall i think this game be pretty hot and like play it . in my opinion the graphic be phenomenal , the storyline keep i interested and it work very well on my laptop with little to no problem . i also really like the fact that it make you think and actually use you brain in order to decide what to do with all the object you have collect however i find myself get stick multiple time in the game . this be my biggest issue and it get to the point where i have to go to a cheat\/walkthrough site just to help move i forward to the next level\/board . i will admit that some object collect make absolutely no sense to i until find out what to do with they after read the walkthrough . and i wish this be not so , because i would have find more satisfaction in solve all the mystery without help but unfortunatley i could not . overall the game be highly enjoyable , highly recommend and i be look forward to play a sequel -lrb- if one exist -rrb- in the near future .

881	Video_Games	POS	5	how complicated must it be for sega to make a game on a console that be still in development at the same time ? and yet , the final game be a smash hit that happen to be pretty top-notch . they have pull through then , i guess . and now that there be a dx version , it be on several other system , include gamecube , xbox , pc , ps3 , etc , so everyone get a opportunity to see this classic . the game let you choose to play as 6 different character -lrb- however , you unlock they by play as sonic first -rrb- . we have sonic -lrb- of course -rrb- , tails , amy , knuckles , e103 omega , and ... big the cat ... each of the character have they own gameplay mechanic , as well as goal and certain level . below be the fun factor for each character . sonic - the level be actually pretty straightforward . you simply go from start to finish . and boy be it fun . . it be actually pretty close to the genesis sonic game , but in 3d . collect ring , bash robot , you know . . the good stuff . plus , there be some new level-specific gameplay mechanic include , like twinkle park 's bumper car ride , and sky chase 's airplane combat ! you may as well buy this game just for sonic alone . after all , as the title character , he have the most level to go through . tail - more or less like sonic 's gameplay except he have to race sonic -lrb- later , eggman , in speed highway -rrb- in each level . it be not as bad as it may sound , because it only just keep the pace go , which be great , and do not you think it be kind of exciting to find shortcut when fly ? knuckle - rather than go from start to finish , knuckles have to find 3 emerald in each level . so how do you do so ? you glide around the place and see if a emerald be pick up on a radar -lrb- really helpful -rrb- , and they could be hide in enemy or other place . the only minor -lrb- and only minor -rrb- downside with knuckles be that there be only about 1 -lrb- or 2 ? -rrb- emerald throughout the game that could only be find by digging into the ground . i be expect knuckles 's digging upgrade to be use a bit more specifically for find emerald . amy - she be not as fast as the above 3 character , but she still be not a bad pick . although have the same robot chase she throughout level be a little cringe-inducing , amy play pretty well , as she can attack with she massive hammer . e103 omega - alright . who expect a robot to be playable in a sonic game ? i certainly have not , but i be glad i be . omega 's gameplay involve massive deal of weaponry , as well as be able to hover later on , and do certain task in the level . in final egg , for example , you must destroy sonic doll . in emerald coast , you catch froggy . in other level , you must go destoy other omega robot ! i absolutely love play as this thing , as much as i love play as the first 3 character . big - big be a pretty lame downside to this game . he be slow , and you have to go fishing for thing . it be as fun as describe , and i certainly do not want to go back to play as he . sadly , you have to beat the game as all character if you want to fight the actual last boss , perfect chaos , so ... ... that pretty much cover up the character . as for everything else , the level design be magnificent and lovingly craft . plus , the graphic be awesome for the time , and the soundtrack rock ! however , sonic adventure dx be not without flaw . there be a few time where the collision get a little awry , and the cutscene be not amazing , too . while the story be nicely do , some bit of dialogue be a bother . oh , yeah , and there be big the cat . nevertheless , these be , again , minor problem , as the game be so much fun that you would hardly think about they . oh yeah , and the unlockable collection of game gear game be a great bonus !

283	Video_Games	POS	4	i get this game a year ago , and it be the first creature game i have ever buy . i have be read review for it for a month , and buy it . when i install the game and start play it , it be great !! the norns be very cute -lrb- even if the only facial expression they show be happyness -rrb- , the ettin steal almost every object on the ship and bring it back to it be home area -lrb- the ettin be my favorite creature to watch , i catch it steal some machinary and tell it to drop it , and it just look at the screen and make a big , cheezy grin at i -rrb- , and the grendle be horrifying ! the only bad thing about this game be the creator , it let you put new object you download on the internet in the game , but you need something call bioenergy ... and ... um ... the power up . -lrb- note : many creature user at the creature newsgroup dislike the power up in creature 2 . creature labs do not know when to stop : - d -rrb- i be look foward to the docking station add-on creature labs will be release for free ! -lrb- you do not need creature 3 to run it , but it dock with it if you have it . -rrb- if you want to buy this game , i recomend that you buy the creatures trilogy in the game . it include c1 , c2 , and c3 all together ! get this game , or the other game , now !
871	Video_Games	POS	4	for 250 dollar , this system be worth it . more importantly , if you be think about buy one , the most promising aspect of this system be the potential for group gaming . the controller , like nintendo advertise , offer a lot of fun for gamer and people who have never touch a video game before -- this aspect beat out the other two , more powerful system . for the most part the controller be strong . now sure there be game out there that be worth play by yourself such as zelda , but i think the biggest grab this system have be the ability to make gaming fun for everyone . this system have the promise of be the number 2 system because of its price and its ability to be play by almost anyone . the one lack point be the graphic . sure , this may only be a minor aspect for some gamer but i argue the shelf life on this system may only run for about 6 year , while other system such as playstation 3 have a lot more time due to people lack the current top of the line technology that the other system offer , ex . blue-ray hdtv etc. . recommend as a system for group gaming , fan of nintendo game , and for serious gamer as a second system .
602	Video_Games	NEG	1	after play for a couple hour i begin to tell some friend how awesome the game be ... three hour later i have to call they all back to tell they how terrible it be . the rest of the review here be 100 % accurate . the game have absolutely no replay value ... i would go as far to say the most fun part of the game be the cell stage . f for effort !
269	Video_Games	NEG	1	its basically a very boring game . add\/change\/lengthen \/ shorten\/widen the leg , foot , face , eye etc and then off u go and hunt and procreate and build a village and enlarge it and bring war\/diplomacy to other villages\/cities and then conquer the entire world and then the whole universe -- equal boring

690	Video_Games	NEG	1	adventure gamer : do not buy this game ! 1 -rrb- it be a series of maze ; 2 -rrb- 90 % of the time you be either kill dead people or the living , and then rekill they after they be dead ; 3 -rrb- there be some inventory item ; 4 -rrb- it be a keyboard game -lrb- i.e. , you have to use both hand to maneuver in the game ; and , 5 -rrb- if you insist upon get this game , make sure you back off every time you kill somebody or you will end up not finish the game ! this game be a waste of my money .
119	Video_Games	NEG	2	while use the sharpshooter with killzone 3 my on-screen reticle track right for no apparent reason . exchange for another just to have the same issue . require constant re-calibration to be playable -lrb- every time the action die down -rrb- . look for a `` fix '' version from sony soon . move wand play flawlessly by itself .
523	Video_Games	NEG	1	a great look game . moody . atmospheric . creepy . unfortunately the pc version be so riddled with bug and lockup that it be almost unplayable ... save you money or at least wait until the manufacturer come out with a patch .
754	Video_Games	NEG	2	it do not suck i in and i do not like that you have to start whole section over if you do not make certain check-point .
605	Video_Games	NEG	1	i be go to buy until i find out about drm . another $ 50.00 bite the dust ea . enjoy you game
304	Video_Games	NEG	1	when i first play this game at my friend 's house , i be astounded by the magnificent graphic and gameplay . wow -- be unlike any other video game i have ever play in my life . i just admire the worgen so much that i quickly become obsess with interest ; however , i keep wonder why my friend would pay ninety-five dollar and a fifteen dollar fee each month for cataclysm . so week pass by after new year day and that be when i discover a advirtisement of the game from amazon . i check the video , picture etc. . i soon realize that my interest be short live , when i learn that i would have to pay for all four game as a whole -lrb- just for the one game -rrb- . not to mention the fifteen dollar monthly fee for a battle.net account . the entire expansion set have a staggering , one-hundred dollar price tag . that be not all . if you do not have the right computer , it will cost you one-thousand buck or more for a mac ! as a blizzard consumer i would suggest that you try they free 10 day trial offer , pick out one you favorite character and make it jump off a cliff ... why ? because it make absolutely no sense to pay for something so expensive . i be very disappointed and unsatisfied . no offense ; i apologize . but as a reasonable gamer i choose to not buy this game until the price be fair . this item be obviously more of a luxury than a game that be why i give up on purchase it .
600	Video_Games	NEG	1	by the time you read this you will have read other review and know that you can not play civ 5 without a steam account and use a internet connection . go be the simple day where you could pop in a cd on you laptop and play civilization . to play civ 5 you have to create a steam account include give they personal information . every time you log into steam to get to civ 5 you have to endure advertisement for they various game they wish to sell . when you start civ 5 , you have to endure the same opening video until you esc . function override several minute into the video . then the game will load ... usually about a five minute delay before you can get back to a save game . lately , the steam server have be unreliable and seem unable to handle the datum transfer for a huge game setup . the game stop mid turn and give you a obvious statement that a error have occur . if you have not save , all you move be lose . it be clear that firaxis and steam havent work out all the bug yet . they have my money now , but my recommendation be not to spend yours . this be a good attempt that have result in a classic failure .
380	Video_Games	NEG	1	when i get my action replay of course i be excite and it fun to use it , but after my first week of have it , it break . when i put the action replay in my dsus with a game the screen come up white . so , i look up how to fix it and it seem like a lot of other people have this problem and could not fix it . so i would not recommend this to anybody .
560	Video_Games	NEG	1	this game be obviously program by people who have little to no historical knowledge of the civil war . the only battle out of the four with even a semblance of the historical military balance be gettysburg . the other three , the `` seven day battle , '' chattanooga , and chancellorsville , bear no resemblance to the actual battle in either landscape or unit involve . and as other reviewer have point out , the `` confederation '' wear blue uniform and the union gray . in addition , artillery unit be so deadly in this game that no other unit can get near they . they can virtually win a battle by themselves , which be certainly not the case in the civil war . the game also crash quite a bit .
792	Video_Games	NEG	1	note : this be not a review of the game , rather of the amazon\/ea install process . you might consider buy it elsewhere . i purchase this through amazon and run they installer . it download the full 7.4 gig folder to you computer . when the download finish 5 hour later it go to install . that then launch the ea\/origin system to authorize the key and install . it accept my key from amazon but would not install the game . it make i redownload the whole thing again . so now 10 hour go and 15gig of bandwidth -lrb- yes some people have to pay for `` excessive '' download -rrb- and i be hope it will actually install . come on amazon and ea ! get you shite together . yes , i try cancel the ea download and re-run the install file from the amazon install , but the ea\/origin system keep refuse to continue .
389	Video_Games	NEG	1	i think this thing suck . i have to save up 180 dollar , andus only get 5 a week . it be too expensive , wheras the gamecube be a mere 100 . the conroller have too many button , and it be too small . the gamecube controller be just right . it do have more game ; i 'll give it that . but , be they all good ? a few , maybe , but most be bloody , gory , rude , and just downright boring . it be mostly sport and shooting . it have no big franchise besides grand theft auto , which i do not understand why it be so fun . nintendoo have : mario , zelda , starfox , metroid , mario kart , plus animal crossing . so , the message i be convey here be ps2 be no good , buy a gamecube .
433	Video_Games	NEG	1	the controller break from the analog thumbstick the first time i use it . the quality of it be just awful . i guess you get what you pay for . at least it should have work a couple month ! do not buy this type of controller from this seller .
730	Video_Games	NEG	1	what be this ? get the game for free . expect a semi-solid shooter with a decent story to keep i play it . well , this be not it . a way too complex game . all the time i be apparently upgrade my character 's abilty in different section . i never have a clue about what these ability do . i get weird name and number , like -lrb- +1 -rrb- maintenance . 3\/4 of the time i do not even have a clue about what be i do , wander around way too dark corridor -lrb- forget about play this game during the day -rrb- try to find something i have no clue what it be . i get halfway trough the game , and i be still use a wrench as a primary weapon . apparently you can use physic power , but it take several minute to select the `` spell '' -lrb- among hundred -rrb- the item , the etc and etc so i just find myself fight with a wrench against horde of zombie that keep come out of nowhere . i once get a pistol but it only have a couple of bullet . i could only find a couple of bullet per level . uninstall it 4 hour after i get it , after the inmense frustration of be kill by the same zombie over and over again , when i have nothing to defend myself with except a wrench , and i have kill he a dozen time . not for i .
840	Video_Games	NEG	1	my husband and son be so excited about this game that against we budget i buy it as a christmas surprise . well they get the surprise . we computer have be busy for day download and download and download this stupid game . you can not play it unless you be online . be you crazy !!!!! we would not allow a continous open gateway for someone to hack into we computer . where be the disc ?? why do bethesda release this game and trick people into something so unfair . what happen to the company that make fun game for pc . my husband and son be so angry . i could have purchase 2 game for the waste $ 50 on `` skyrat '' what a scam bethesda . never again . beware and know that this game be like a control parent that will have they way like it or not . dont buy . i only wish amazon would give we we money back . oh yeah , this crappy steam company will not allow you to `` sell the game back '' it be a one owner purchase period . it be the last that bethsda will ever see from we !
176	Video_Games	NEG	2	i be probably you semi-average person who have end up buy this game ... someone who be have not be exercise in a while , but be not horribly out of shape either . i hate go to the gym -lrb- take too much time to drive there & back , wait for equipment to be free , etc -rrb- and so i be look for a way to get some exercise at home . i be not expect too much out of the work out since i do not have any weight or equipment at home . what i want be something to help guide i through a exercise plan and help motivate i to do they on a regular basis . pro : be that i be end up get a better work out then i expect , but i have to push a bit harder then the in game coaching would indicate so i guess i should change the difficulty from medium to hard . there be a fair bit of diversity in the exercise , but you will often end up do the same exercise in a single session . overall a decent mix . the in game coaching be pretty good . give good tip on proper form and some motivation . i be actually surprised how un-cheesy it end up be overall . obviously not as good as work out with a personal trainer at the gym , but it be really hard to fault they at all here . con : the tracking be really really bad at time . there be time i be stand absolutely still and it show i do reps. wtf ? there be exercise which require big movement and it tell i it be wait for i to start . it be really frustrating since sometimes it work great and the next day it be horrible . once i decide to do all the exercise session all over again since i want to push harder only to quit because the tracking go from great to a drunken merry-go-round in 5 minute . there be a lot of little nit-pick i could do , like when it tell you to get some water and then do not give you \* any \* extra time to walk the 3 foot and take a sip . or how the menu system be really slow . start the game be slow . the whole point of console game be suppose to be you insert the disk and go ! but easa2 for some reason have the worst menu system i have ever see in a ps3 game and it hurt my enthusiasm every time i start a work out because i be constantly wait for the screen to refresh . not to mention the stupid load screen between each and every exercise . you can not tell i the ps3 do not have enough horsepower to load the next exercise in the background and they could easily add a `` next up : xxxxx '' scroll on the screen to let you know what be next without make you stand there with nothing to do other then pick you nose . there be other issue with the game you 'll hear about if you read other review here on amazon - they be all true . and that be the real problem with the game , the in game coach do a pretty good job of motivate you and they seem to have do a good job come up with a exercise plan , but the game itself be so flaw that you actually do not want to use it . actually , if i could just turn off the tracking other then the heart rate monitor and just follow along on my own , it would actually be pretty decent and i would find myself want to exercise with easa2 rather then drag my foot and miss schedule workout because i loath it so much . that say , i use to do muay thai so i 'll probably give the fight : light out a try .
97	Video_Games	NEG	1	skyrim be basically just like oblivion , if not only because after 50 hour thing get really boring . sure , there be still `` thing to do '' but they be only that -- chore . that say , i do not find it be as fun as oblivion or fallout 3 . this be because all those game appear on the same console . oblivion come after morrwind , which be a console generation away , and for that reason its newness compound with the nature of the game and give we great fun , for awhile . now , 6 year later , we be rather desensitize to the technology that make oblivion possible and so skyrim feel like 'd eja vu ' . there be also the fact that the whole lotr mystique have dissappear , which help morrowind and oblivion gain they popularity . some of we just grow up . i simply could not help but judge this game to be a fetch-fest . now , if you have never play a elder scrolls then i can understand why you would give it 5 star , since this be basically oblivion with a facelift . the graphic be outstanding on the ps3 but the main problem , as everyone know , be the lag . i will not comment any further other than to acknowledge that on ps3 it be persistant after you save file cross the 5 mb threshold and that i have have 4 hard crash , even after the 1.2 patch . in 2006 i be mildly intrigue by oblivion 's story , partly because i be younger but for some reason skyrim 's seem glib . i be older now but even so the game 's narrative lack any cohesion . the dragon be a anti-climax and that be crucial since the whole story revolve around they . they be not as mysterious as mehrunes dagon and seem rather anomalous . there be also no reason to believe they can destroy world when they themselves can be destroy by a few spell or iron arrow . all of oblivion 's deficiency remain . the in-game juridicial system be garbage . pick up a loaf of bread and you will die or get on the wrong horse and die . there be only a handful of class and the best become wear out because of how easy it be to spam smithe with iron dagger . once again there be a entire sub-class know as bandit who just happen to be in place and attack you on sight . never mind that a economy exist in skyrim and that there be animal everywhere , and thus food and clothing . there be bandit leader and what not , all of which feel thoroughly date . the combat be just as poor as in oblivion . the finishing-move be script and become redundant after only a few hour . the player swing a axe or sword with the same move . good thing be that arrow actually work now . the substance of all the story depend on read journal or book . i find it absolutely impossible to read anything in a videogame , and so this part really fail . good news be that the race look better . the bad be that they do not really matter . i choose to be a high elf but this have absolutely no bearing on my relation with the thalmor . they treat i as if i be a nord . the nords notice this if you help they but its still meaningless as they suddenly forget you be a elf but still curse elf in general . the thalmor call i a ` foreigner ' and yet they only recently arrive in skyrim , home of the nords . make no sense whatsoever . the same apply to vampires . i be a vampire and would be instantly attack by other vampire as i roam the tundra , even though these vampire who attack i be get along fine with each other . there be cave fill entirely with vampire , all of whom be have a good time , yet whenever i show up they all gang up on i . this be part of the reason why elder scroll game be consider by some critic to be extremely shallow , and frankly they be shallow . read my fallout 3 review to see my own take on this . the world of skyrim look fantastic , but it be so big that , as everyone say , the game bog down on ps3 due to its divide memory pool . after you explore enough tomb , you will find that the dragur be sorely mundane . yet that be also true of the skeleton and what not in oblivion . ultimately , the worse thing be that , due to the story , skyrim be even more de-centralized than oblivion so that the purpose of the game be `` do stuff '' . if you be a vampire then this be go to get old fast since you 'll have to feed so as to not kill everyone . heck , vampire really have no advantage in this game other than frost resistance . what be worse be that they be be not as many guild or organization as in oblivion , so the fetch-quest you have to busy yourself with be even more scatter , anomalous and ultimately meaningless . edit 1\/23\/2012 i forget to mention something . the old leveling system of morrowind and oblivion have be abolish . this both break with tradition and decrease the ceiling of whatever ` skill ' you wish to augment , all of which be trade for a freeder and more moderate manner of leveling . in other word , specialization be go at the expense of rapid increase in skill per level . also , in skyrim bethesda have absolutely neutered magic . one of the thing i enjoy in oblivion be the sheer amount of variability in ` magic ' . all of that be go in skyrim and it have be replace with ` spell tome ' where you just open a book and learn a spell . whats more be that these thing be often sell at exorbitant price . sorely disappointing .
299	Video_Games	NEG	2	this game be not like the original battlefield or desert combat . no vehicle war whatsoever . only 32 player max . this game suck .
794	Video_Games	NEG	2	one of the first game that i ever play on my tandy 1000ex in the late 1980 's be the original kings quest . i fall in love with the series and from that point on a common christmas present for i be acquire parts ii , iii , iv and v when they come out . unfortunatly i still have the old tandy when part v come out and i have to purchase a new computer to enjoy the game . since i play these game since i be a kid i feel that i have some idea about it and a lot of feeling towards this series . the truth be i love it and over the year i have use various program to play my old game on windows xp . this release disappoint i for several reason which i will list here : 1 . the original version of kings quest 1 be not available on this release . that ruin this entire box set becuase the interface between the remake version from 1990 and the original kings quest 2 -lrb- both of which be include in this box set -rrb- be so different that it ruin the flow of the game . include the original version would have take up very little space on the cd 's and make this a complete set . this be akin to own a set of movie a owning all of they except for the first film . the first movie be almost always the best one . i think it be a mistake to do it in this fashion . 2 . i do agree with many reviewer on amazon that this set need to include the other game which be include in king quest collection 2 . that a big disappointment . 3 . booklet and extra . the best thing about the old version of kings quest be that you get a nice box , nice booklet and information about the series . the fact that that do not even take the time to reprint one of the old booklet be very unfortunate . 4 . i do not care for the box art . it be a poor take off of the original box of kings quest iii . 5 . the copy protection in kings quest iv and v be never remove . grant it would have be difficult to edit the game i think it would have be nice if it be not present .
32	Video_Games	NEG	1	ok we buy this after a article about a inexpensive solution for shooting `` tethered '' but wirelessly with the nikon d4 , which have a ethernet port . the idea be that you could use this thing to basically convert the eth port to wifi so that you could send photo directly to you computer or ipad or whatever . shoot , photo be send to computer , do . the nikon solution cost like , $ 900 , so this seem like a good option . the problem be that this thing require external power to run , so now you be either need to be plug into a wall or you have to buy a batter pack of some sort , which increase the size and awkwardness of use you camera . the d4 be already a huge camera already . the other thing be that this do not even include a power cable , and without a battery pack , it be totally worthless to i .
546	Video_Games	NEG	1	i have thoroughly play battlefield 3 and despite the bug it really be a fantastic game . it really be . definitely one of my favorite game now and definitely my favorite over call of duty . however !!! and this be a big however . origin , the pointless ea software that you have to use\/have in order to play the game , be a really poor excuse for ea to literally spy on you computer as much as they want . i have read some of the agreement you have to check in order to play the game as well as read a bunch about it online and it basically say that by check `` i agree to these term '' you give ea the rights to take and sell any information they find on you computer to 3rd party company as well as use it for they be on gain . this be the same thing they do with the original mass effect all over again . if you new to the hole ea see , be aware , they be a shifty company and frequently try thing like this . they frequently take advantage of they customer and frakly be not to be trust . stay away from ea whenever possible ! how south park portray they in one of they newer episode be absolutely spot on . trust i , ea evil in many way .
779	Video_Games	NEG	2	i play this game until chapter 12 -lrb- 13 chapter total -rrb- and i can not continuous to play because it be too boring . good : 1 . very beautiful graphic . the cut scene be awesome . 2 . lightning voice be very good in english version . 3 . the new battle system work well . 4 . the strategy guide be very beautiful . con : 1 . the story be bore . i like the ff7 and ff10 better . the graphic be beautiful but miss a good story behind 2 . the game play be too simple . basically , you just keep move forward . keep hit the `` x '' button during the battle . you might need to change the battle mode once a while . imagine you keep do this for 60-80 hour . 3 . after you win the game , you use you point\/experience to build up you character . upgrade the character take lot of extra time and effort . 4 . over all , the game have no surprise in storyline and the game play be just too boring . you just repeat to do the something until the game finish .
770	Video_Games	NEG	1	i have to be honest in say that i have fun do those . . i have to also say that i hate be lost . . literally lost . because of bad direction . . and no compass on the screen . . so you do not know where the heck you be , or be go . . literally hour of real time game play . . just be lose . i have to say honestly that if i have not discover the mod , and fast travel cheat , i would have toss it out after the first few try . .
910	Video_Games	NEG	1	the drm be insane . i can not even install the game to play on separate account on the same computer . they need to offer a family pack or something similar . i do not mind ` rent ' a game if the drm scheme be reasonable but what be use for spore make it very family unfriendly .
805	Video_Games	NEG	1	the game be poorly optimize for pc , i can not recommend buy it as it currently be . a patch be release today which seem to make thing worse for some people , i include , but some other people claim it fix they stuttering issue , so that be kind of a gamble . if they do manage to fix the stutter issue , +2 star !
499	Video_Games	NEG	1	do not buy this game ! this be doubly true for anyone who like either of the previous mass effect game ! the control be terrible , the graphic suck , character animation be buggy and often look worse than in mass effect 1 and 2 and the plot , this be the worst story i have ever see in any game ever which really make the game a no-buy consider that the gameplay be like a seriously broken version of gears of war so the plot be the only reason to play the game in the first place . without go into spoiler territory , i 'll just say that the end be a series of continuity fail lead into a nonsensical and gratingly annoying end which be a very badly execute deus ex rip-off which make no sense , take none of you action in either this game or the previous one into account , give you no meaningful choice , blows-up the world and leave you with a bad taste in you mouth such that you will never want to play another bioware ever again . do not believe anyone who tell you that this game be open-ended , it be not ! it be linear crap that force you to watch you character refuse to challenge the most absurd decision make by the reaper overlord . take back earth ! wrong ! watch shepherd sit by passively while the reaper overlord destroy the universe be the only option you get for a end . also , the multiplayer be broken in addition to be a really badly execute and boring rip-off of gear of war 's horde mode . in fact , if you be even think of buy this game , do not ! buy gears of war instead since it be better in every way -lrb- and this be come from someone who love the previous mass effect game , do not like gears of war that well and pre-ordered this atrocity against gamer . -rrb- if you really want a poorly execute gears-of-war rip-off game about sucking-up to a emo-omnicidal villain , well this game be a epic fail even in that category . do not buy this game !
340	Video_Games	NEG	1	ok it supposedly load , but on try to run it , it insist `` press pause\/break to start '' . my keyboard -lrb- & likely yours -rrb- do not include those particular key . the customer ` support ' be from rumania . the loading-interface be most impressive . but this be truly the most frustrating software i have ever deal with in the last 40yr .
493	Video_Games	NEG	1	daughter save she own money to purchase this . it work for 3 day . if it be available , i would give it 0 star .
43	Video_Games	NEG	2	it be amazing to i that when the original pac-man come out in the early eighty . it be house in a eight-foot tall console . now that original game can be hold in you hand with three other variation .  anyway , unless you be already a fan of the game , i would not bother . to make the character large enough to be easily recognizable , they have to scroll the rest of the board , which make strategy very difficult .  in addition , the tetris knockoff they include be just that ... a knockoff , and next to worthless .
955	Video_Games	NEG	1	i love halo on the xbox . truly the first or second best shooter on any platform . `` half life on the pc be the other contender '' . on my multimedia super killer dell wide screen notebook with the new pentium m processor , nvidia fx 5650 go video with 128 mb video ram and 1 gig of main memory , halo performance be abysmal .  i figure the other who say this may have be a bit over the top . they werent ! for microsoft to have release this piece of drek be irresponsible in the extreme . it be the full halo game and if you set to the higher resolution , the scenery be gorgeous , but , but , but !  unfortunately , even with virtually all the pretty video feature turn off and resolution set down to a abysmal 800x600 , the massive frame rate -lrb- and motion update -rrb- slowing -lrb- to as bad as less than 1 frame per second -rrb- that take place whenever major scene motion occur -lrb- especially in the middle of gunfight and always during in battle reloading -rrb- . make the game practically unplayable . i complete halo on the xbox in normal and heroic mode . but the pc version in standard mode be go to be a real challenge because the frame rate and sluggish mouse update be so bad . really , really bad .  there be thing that could have be do to fix these issue before release , but let face it with halo2 loom , microsoft have to dump it out here now to have any chance of sell it at all . half life work on the pc and have a truly excellent interface . they do use lower resolution figure and scenery , but the whole thing work together . halo on the pc be on the other end of that spectrum .  do not buy this game , it be awful ! go out and buy a xbox and get halo for it . xbox halo , alone be worth buy a xbox for . the only thing of value in the pc version be the box it come in .
146	Video_Games	NEG	1	seriosly , it be not that good of a game it be a waste of 50 buck just to see some tid if u be read this that mean you online so go to a xxx website do not spend 50 doller it be ... . . sad
947	Video_Games	NEG	2	i be a huge fan of mass effect and play first 2 game plus read all the book and love they . even after many year both mass effect 1 and 2 be on my hard drive until i purchase and play mass effect 3 . game play be great , graphic be pretty decent , voice acting be superb as usual , but that be where the great thing end and disappointment start . not to get into too many detail ... game write could have be much better . most of the character conversation consist of simple question and blunt and cliche response -lrb- joke compare to first two installment -rrb- . which bring i to the absolutely disappointing end , i mean horrible dissapointing ending , i mean extremely horrible dissapointing ending , it be like compare matrix -lrb- the movie -rrb- to matrix 3 . i be a mature gamer who can tolerate some distasteful writing but this ... this be beyond distasteful ... the whole mass effect plot break down , crash and burn in last 15 min of game play , it feel like you just change to a different game . i uninstall all 3 game and wish i have never purchase mass effect 3 so i could still have some good memory about this franchise .
125	Video_Games	NEG	1	this be not a review of the game but the delivery system . they do research a while back and determine that online shopper be less likely to buy a product if they have to create a separate online account . with this game you can not even play a single player game without set up a online account with steam and then have to wait to start it up while it update . if i would have know about all this i would not have purchase .
147	Video_Games	NEG	1	i buy this game for my 5 year old - who love barbie and the magic of pegasus . big mistake ! my husband and i have have to help she with most of the game . eventually , we all give up . at one point in the game you have to use the mouse in a circular motion to change the `` horse '' into brietta . we give up because we all have sore arm from try ! if you want to buy a great `` barbie '' computer game . . choose barbie princess and the pauper ! the game be fun and my 5 year old love it ! this game be a christmas present and i would return it if i could !!!
943	Video_Games	NEG	1	games from disney interactive consistently do not work for i . they run slowly , crash , and freeze .
753	Video_Games	NEG	1	i be 16 hour into this game , and be very close to finish . i enjoy it a lot up to this point . but i can not recommend this game to anyone , and i can only hope to steer clear any that try and buy this . after complete the slaughterhouse i go back to iri hq . funny thing be i be able to walk through double hh , which i thought be odd because he be usually in the way . well that be the last i saw of he . he never appear again so i can not finish the game . -lrb- ... -rrb-
520	Video_Games	NEG	1	do not waste you money on this game if you want to play the multiplayer online . i beta test for over a month with no problem . install digital version and only single player work . there be either a problem with the game it self , punkbuster or compatability with windows 7 x64 . or all the above . i would request a refund but the place i purchase from do not do any refund for ea game only . if i would have read all the fine print never would have purchase this game .
386	Video_Games	NEG	1	i have be a avid fan of the previous four civilization game and be very shock to find in order just to install civ 5 i need to subscribe to the service of steam . i have dealings with this company once before and find they gaming service do not always work and get in touch with they support be next to impossible . the game description say `` initial installation require one-time internet connection for steam authentication '' but even after authentication it require steam to load so by `` one-time '' i guess it mean once every time you try to play the game . i be return the game now .
796	Video_Games	NEG	1	in many respects this sim be inferior to fs2004 . the frame rate be terrible and the aircraft viewpoint too fussy to get to quickly . anyone with fs2004 and with good add on scenery i would advise to stay with it . my computer be state of the art with dual core pcu , nvidea 7900gt graphic . over new york in fs2004 with all slider max out i get over 35 fp , with fsx i get 7 fp . with slider at normal and a slide show . i have since uninstalled my fsx and return to fs2004 .
819	Video_Games	NEG	1	i be disappointed with this fourth pajama sam . my six year old son and i love the first three title of pajama sam . so when he want the `` it be rough when you lose you stuff '' one , i say , `` sure '' . there be no arguement from i , the previously satisfied customer .  he want i to hurry up with my shopping , so he could get home and start play the cd . i help he install the game , and we sit back to enjoy we favorite animated character .  the first thing i notice be that sam 's voice sound different . also , he mouth do not match with the dialogue . it look like a japanese karate movie that have be redubb with english word . how could the producer have miss that ?  secondly , the esc keep do not work to help you zoom through the scene on you way around the map to find the miss object . -lrb- it do on the first three version . call i spoil ? but why do away with a great feature ? sam do a lot of run around -rrb- . so , we wait as he walk from this path to that path ... wait ... wait and wait ...  thirdly , the game lag ! i think my new computer -lrb- purchase this year , mind you -rrb- be mess up . how could it lag ? this be not a multiplayer game on the internet for cry out loud . it be as if the professional people turn this product over for elementary school child to produce . it be that far down quality wise from the first three .  i be disappointed and disgusted . i wish i have read the earlier amazon review , but i trust the quality of humongous entertainment and do not dream of read the feedback . i learn my lesson . no more buying of any software without listen to those who have already be sucker or thrill .  listen -- if you want to buy quality fun game for you kid , go with pajama sam 1-3 . leave number 4 in the store . believe i , it be rough when you lose you money .  thanks .  ps . i do like one thing , the sock song . that be it ... : -lrb-
977	Video_Games	NEG	1	my 4-yr old whose fairly computer savvy sum it up best when he say `` this be too boring '' ... strangely complicate to install , hard to navigate , and not much payoff when you do get to place . for i it be too much of what be bad about the cars movie -lrb- the story\/characters -rrb- and not enough of what be good about it -lrb- action\/graphics -rrb- . if you value you $ 20 , stay on the interstate and zoom past this radiator springs adventure .
661	Video_Games	NEG	1	all the problem people have with the drm on mass effect apparently do not teach ea a lesson , and they deserve this now . with a limit of 3 install , which you do not get back for uninstall . imagine if a patch go wrong and you have to reinstall . you get a new hard drive and reinstall . then you decide you computer be too slow , so you upgrade you system , and you go to reinstall ... and discover you be go to have to call ea and beg , and if you get through the long hold time and computer-controlled phone menu , they might relent and let you play the game you pay for . but maybe not . this have already happen to people who play mass effect , which have the same system . guy install , try to play ; get on-screen artifact , so he reinstall xp . problem not help , so he replace he video card - trigger activation # 3 . he finish it , uninstalled to save space , but get the bug to play again a couple week later . reinstall , and get this message : `` the game can not start . for security reason , only a limited number of machine can ever be license by a single purchase . this limit have be reach . please purchase another registration code , reinstall , and then try again . '' purchase another registration code ? how about when i buy something , i get to decide when and how i use it , and not you ? thanks , but no thanks . no way , no how , no crippling drm .
887	Video_Games	NEG	2	the game be the original and that be fun , goofy campy , corny fun . but the softaware and the support be horrendous , i try to re-install on my recently purchase computer -lrb- vista home premium -rrb- and could install but not play it
261	Video_Games	NEG	1	i buy this headset for my son despite the bad review and regret it . this item work for almost a week and then the sound start cut in and out , now my son say it do not work at all . it be a good price but you will not have a headset after a week or two . do yourself a favor and opt for a better quality item .
789	Video_Games	NEG	1	i could not wait to buy this game , but now i be go to . the drm be reprehensible and i will not purchase until it be go .
921	Video_Games	NEG	1	i be excite to get this unit so that i would not have to always change out which system i have hook up in my little office on my little tv . the system work great , mostly . although i do notice some glitch , it be good enough to say that it be justify in price . good thing there be controller port for each system that work , because the include wireless one simply do not work . neither of they . at all . period . i be pretty tick off about that as it show they have no quality control whatsoever . i decide to return it and try again hope i get a work set . i might come back and post a follow up if the next set works\/doesn ' t work .
632	Video_Games	NEG	1	i would have simply return the two fake wii remotes i receive , but they be christmas gift from a relative who do not provide i a receipt . that say , he purchase two white remote from amazon that be probably fill by a vendor -lrb- sell by ____ and fulfil by amazon -rrb- . the remote be very good fake . i go on several site try to determine if they be , and do not know at first . the giveaway ? terrible speaker on the phone ; second , the wii motionplus barely work . then , one of they just quit work all together . another giveaway be the model number on the heel of the remote . also , the graphic on the bottom side be inaccurate . i be able to compare these after go to a brick and mortar store and buy one . so now , i have two worthless piece of junk that my family member pay full price for . thanks amazon ! check you vendor out more !
56	Video_Games	NEG	2	i pick this up instead of the new medal of honor . the guy at gamestop say it blow away mw2 and the new moh . oh how wrong be he . first off , i be a very big campaign player . i play online sometimes when i get bore , but mostly i be into the campaign . mw2 's story line be far better than this one , yeah the campaign be cool and have its twist and turn but it be sub par in my opinion . i have see much better . graphic be good , but not great , a couple new weapon and feature be add that help out some . i be not go to spoil anything in the story for those of you who want to try it . online play be typical cod , more like waw than mw though . it really would have be nice to see they do something longer and stop concentrate so much on the online ply . i understand that be where the money be at , but some people like both world . the only nice addition be the extra zombie game option , but its just like world at war game play wise so if you have waw , save you money . instead of spending so much money on advertising this game with kobe and jimmy , they should have put it into the game . i can not believe i buy this . i be head to gamestop now to trade in this so call great first person shooter . long story short , i should have buy medal of honor .
394	Video_Games	NEG	2	these headphone be great with the exception of a couple thing . 1 . they go through battery like you wouldnt believe . if you tv be close enough i would go with the wire . 2 . mine do not work anymore and i be roughly 2 week over my return date for amazon . i can return they for half what i pay for they but seriously who want to do that . the problem with mine be you can barely hear any sound with they turn all the way up and other player voice go in and out . i have put new battery in it and it do not change anything . this item would probably be best buy at a store where you can do a even exchange if something like this come up .
635	Video_Games	NEG	1	this seem to be a decent headset at first with only minor audio glitch occasionally . however i wind up go through battery every 4 or 5 gaming session which be just far too often and wasteful if you be too lazy to manage rechargeable . on top of that it be not turn on at all , after only a couple month of casual use . incase anyone know how to fix it it will not turn on but the battery heat up a lot
950	Video_Games	NEG	1	this screen protector show the iphone right on the packaging that you receive it in . it would be nice if they would show the packaging in the picture of the product so you could clearly see what you be get . instead they show the screen protector and a psp go . the screen protector do not fit the go correctly . spend the extra money and go for the sony product .  pspgo protective screen film
78	Video_Games	NEG	1	that be pretty much it . the game have steam and steam require broadband . i do not know that ... i do not remember the instruction on this site say it require broadband , so i buy it . i do not have broadband . oh well . i have get the other fallout story ... they do not require anything special . sure would have be nice to know .
121	Video_Games	NEG	1	as long as i have to install origin this game will never enter my pc . over 50 $ for buy ea spyware - this be a bit of a stretch . watch out for the other review and get a idea , what datum origin gather in detail ... tax return file , photo , messenger program . no way !
128	Video_Games	NEG	2	be new to x-box i decide to buy this remote on a suggestion from a friend . i have be use this for 2 month now and have run into many problem so far with this controller . first issue i have be with the r2 & l2 button . while all the other button on this controller be very touch sensitive and react with amazing speed , these two button appear to have a longer throw to active the button . mainly use this to play call of duty you can imagine with even the smallest delay can be frustrating . after about a month of adult use -lrb- no throwing , slamming or mistreat involve -rrb- the r2 button would glitch and be intermittent when depress -lrb- again very frustrating with cod -rrb- . now it seem the l2 button be start to glitch in the same way , when depress it would active only like it be be push half way ? i would have also like to see a larger separation between the extra `` programmable '' button and the standard r1 button , be so tight together you often activate both of they when you go to use the extra button . there be other smaller issue that i will not go into as this be longer than expect . i be chalk this up as a lesson learn and will trash this controller and go back to purchase a standard controller .
86	Video_Games	NEG	2	-lrb- note : the follow review will be for the female-exile path , as i have not play the male version and do not intend to sit through this game a second time to see how it play out . this also contain spoilers . you have be warn . -rrb- the word ` void ' and ` echo ' be use no less than twenty time -lrb- probably more -rrb- throughout this game to describe the new sith threat . however , it also describe the game as a whole . when i start play this , i be so - enthralled - . i have wait for about half a year to get my hand on the much-anticipated sequel to , imo , the greatest game in existance . i be play it nearly non-stop since i buy it . now that i have finally make it to the end , i be leave with nothing but a unsatisfied , empty feeling in my gut . voice acting : most of the voice be excellent . i have some trouble with a few of they , though . mandalore 's voice seem to change from talk through a helmet and talk without the helmet a couple of time , despite the fact that he outfit never change . a few of the npc speak so quietly i could not hear a word they say . there be - many - time the word do not match the subtitle . game play : my computer have the - recommend - component , and it lock up every other time the load screen pop up . there be ton of glitch , and some problem just due to bad programming -lrb- like people stand up or fall down when they be not suppose to in the movie , force shield disappear when you be talk to people who be capture , mouth move when that character be not the one talking , etc -rrb- . on another note , there be hardly - any - direction . in this one , you be pretty much just walk around without a purpose , hope to bump into whatever the heck it be you be look for . character : at first , i would have say that the cast of the second be even better than the first , but i still have a few reservation . i would give up mira to have bastila again any day . kreia be annoying , and it seem no matter what i say , i lose influence with she . hk-47 be - terribly - underused in this one . romance : terrible . although it be great in the beginning , the tension build up and just do not go anywhere . when i first meet atton , i be think , ` boy ! this guy be - so - much better than carth . ' but complete lack of conversation make the tension dull a little quick . where in kotor , carth be give revan the ' i want to be you reason for live ' speech , in kotor ii around the same place , atton be still skulk in the dark , leering at the exile and bad-mouth the disciple but never confront the issue . the character of the disciple get farther than atton do by actually - admit - he feeling for the exile to atton , and it make it hard to believe that - atton - be in fact the female character 's main love interest . it be pathetic , to say the least . storyline : ous . so it start off very well . i keep playing , get farther through the game and wait for the climax . i be think up conspiracy theory in my head . could atton , or even sion be a resurrect malak ? be kreia secretly bastila or revan , either disguise herself with the force , or somehow twist by this new emptiness that plague the galaxy ? with all this talk of echo , be nihilus just a echo of one of the other character , a second living embodiment create by the force ? so many different possibility , so many different way it could go . but eventually , i get to the end , and it go - nowhere - . after 96 or so hour of playing , i be leave with nothing . there be no resolution , no answer . where be revan ? i do not know . do atton really deal with he past , and do he love the exile ? i do not know . what relation do kreia have with revan , or with the exile ? i do not know . what be the point of play this entire game ? i just do not know . and now , i be leave with only broken promise , built-up excitement that come crash down on i . there be no satisfying ending , no answer , no nothing . and i refuse to believe that this end be somehow justified simply for the promise of another sequel . kotor i have a perfect , satisfying end , and it still leave - plenty - of room for a sequel . whereas i have replay kotor three or four time , i can not even bring myself to play the sequel a second time , just to be grossly disappointed again as i reach the end .
883	Video_Games	NEG	2	it may have the brand name , but it be fake . the button be hard to push aka soft . it be just overall low quality . it do work , the battery life also be low quality . came here fast , and it still work .
816	Video_Games	NEG	1	i will never understand why there be so much hype for halo . . the first one be a sub-average game , the second one be garbage , and surprise surprise the third one suck as well ... the game be boring and slow pace , the graphic be nothing to write home about , and there seem to be very little change in the gameplay from the first two in the series . if people be so desperate for a decent fp , either get bioshock , or wait for unreal tournament 3 . . buyer beware , this game be trash !
278	Video_Games	NEG	1	this game look great . worked half ass for the first 2 hour then gun will not calibrate for the last 30 min . biggest p.o.s game i have come across yet . take it back right now .
311	Video_Games	NEG	2	i be very excite to get this game , and could not believe it be such a let down . i want something to get i up and off the couch -lrb- reason for kinect ! -rrb- , and this game want you to sing ! i do not want to sing . you can not turn the singing function off either . it be really really difficult to do the move . definitely not worth $ 50 !!!
659	Video_Games	NEG	1	after 4 hour of update my ps3 i get from amazon , and then update and install update for this simple stupid game , i have 6 hour into it , -- it do not work ... waste my whole christmas day . . i just want a game deck with good graphic and to play a simple racing game with my wife . . do not buy this game !! i hate this on-line gaming crap , i just want to race a cool car and pass a few hour away . . not get into on-line sign-up , community , stats , and give my family history to a bunch of a \*\* hole !
814	Video_Games	NEG	1	if you buy this drm-infested game , you can only install it three time - after that , you have to call a hotline to activate it again . you do not buy but rent it , but only for the full buying price . no thanks , this be rip of the customer . we do not need this , instead buy another game that let you do what you want with it .
65	Video_Games	NEG	1	pre order this . get it today at two in the afternoon . it be 7 o ' clock and i cant get it to run . get error message from origin that say that they be experience activation issue !! i wish i could get my money back or at least have a word with whoever think origin would be a good idea ! no wonder game be be pirate ! this review be not about the game itself , cause i have not been able to play it !!!!! -rrb- it be more on the frustrating experience of pay 59 dollar for something that you wait for so eagerly only to receive and not be able to play it ! update since i get the game , it have be nothing but issue after issue . first , the intallation , then the bug and not be able to play the multiplayer . the latest issue : the game lag tremendously even in the single player campaign . -lrb- i have a gtx 570 slus setup , pair with a core i5 2500k , 16gb of corsair vengenace ram and a ssd ! -rrb- i have have it and simply decide to delete origin and bf3 from my hdd ! i strongly recommend not to buy this game . march 2nd ,2012 update decide to give it another try . i install it -lrb- same lengthy process , but no problem now -rrb- run the game and everything be sweet ... for a moment . a update be release and guess what ? it do not work again .
358	Video_Games	NEG	2	if you be a gamer this be not the game for you ! the price of 50bones be to much for this game ! this be play with mini games that last about 4 seconds and by the time you catch the hang of the mini game its over ! the game do show a lot with the wii remote but this be not the game for gamer ! this game be more for heck i do not know not sure its for anybody it should have just be a demo game ! please rent it before you buy it ! but if you need it for your collection of games you can sure add it to the what the heck pile . but i must say there be some parts that will make you laugh but this be truely not what your looking for in the 2007 i be left with only a few word and that what the heck !
914	Video_Games	NEG	2	after many frustrating attempt to install the power tool , i go to the hasbro website and find out that you can only play the game with the mouse if you have windows xp ... what a bummer this be to my six and four year old son . they still have fun play it with the mouse , but it be not they first choice . thankfully , i order this when it be 50 % off , or tonka joe would really be on my list !!
668	Video_Games	NEG	2	buy a wireless and love it for the few week it work until the joystick break . bought another one and guess what ? it not only break but in the same place ! this one last a few week as well .
909	Video_Games	NEG	1	i have buy the game . i stand in line at wal-mart and have a great conversation with the wal-mart employee while i wait for the unveiling of the game . i have wait 2 year . then the game come out of the box . i rush home to wait 45 min to the install . it be 12:45 by the time the install be complete . no biggie . i could not wait anymore . i get on the game . i stay up until 4pm that sunday morning play the game . i be already in the end of the tribal age before i go to bed . i be take my time like drink good wine . i like to at least enjoy the game a bit . i wake up to continue play the rest of the day that afternoon . i be already in the space age before i go to sleep . since then , the space age be just too tedious for i . there be nothing great to it . it be like a math game for kindergartner . i will not lie - it do make i feel like i be great because i finish the game so quick . con : -lrb- 1 -rrb- after 2 year and constant tease with the game , they could not have make the game play just a little harder . i read many review before i decide to make my own . it be true . someone say , `` there be something miss between each stage . '' read the review before mine for the source . this person be correct . you start off as a cell and before you know it , you be in a space ship . by the time you start do very well and want to take over more tribe or civilization , it be already time to go to the next level . a big disappointment . and there be no random factor in it . there be only so many tribe to take out or befriend each time . -lrb- 2 -rrb- i also do not like the fact that you can not add more leg or head or anything to make a stronger , faster , more mobile unit . -lrb- example : a jaw that give +2 bite will over ride the +1 bite no matter how many +1 bite you have . you will only get +2 bite . -rrb- -lrb- 3 -rrb- the end game really suck . it do seem fun at first with the ability to take over million of planet and spread you colony but it be really tedious and boring . it be miss something like point # 4 . -lrb- 4 -rrb- i know it be a lack on my part but i really believe before i buy the game that there be multiplayer ability . i really want to partner with my bro and level up . then i get the game , then really hope for the best that i need to `` get to a certain part '' in order to `` interact '' with my bro . however , this have fail i . ea only copy you creation and randomly put they in other people 's game so if you come across a new race , you will see someone else 's creation which add the random factor into the game . this would have be fine for random aus unit but this game would have rise to the top if it be a multiplayer game or better yet a mmorpg . maybe you have to play offline to level up you own creation then you could upload it to the ea server once you be ready to go for the mmorpg . all lose hope . -lrb- 5 -rrb- i play the game on a normal level . this game could have be much harder . on other game , `` normal '' setting be usually the point where i break into a game to test its limit . instead of `` normal '' it should have have the setting as `` preschool '' -lrb- 6 -rrb- i do not like the 3 activation and i want to make the statement with everyone else . rock on guy ! occasionally , i will format my computer because of a suspect virus or trojan , and the fact that i have to call after 3 time be go to pizzle i off . i should not be worry since i have beat the game anyways . pro : -lrb- 1 -rrb- be a good believer of my faith in evolution , i like the concept of the game . i like the fact you play `` god '' and you have the ability to manipulate the process of what we call `` evolution . '' i could make a huge neck or add wing . i make my people look like bumblebee with yellow and black . everything be black and yellow in my game with a black stripe . i have fun with the design , the concept , and some of the game play . -lrb- 2 -rrb- although there be a lot of people complain about the `` infected software , '' i never have a problem install . i do not do anything else during the install . i leave my computer run and that be it . i be not sure what many be talk about . -lrb- 3 -rrb- i do want to say that i like the drm idea -lrb- read on first -rrb- . there be so many people upset that be say they be treat like a crook and actually admit to have install on more than 3 pc . the general idea be you can only install one copy on one pc per software title in they term of service -lrb- to -rrb- on most software . people who be break those rule be do the same as steal from store or take credit for someone 's work . since i have say all that , i like the idea because no matter how secure you make something , there be go to be someone dedicate to crack it . i will doubt there will ever be such a thing as a `` uncrackable game . '' per zdnet , there be a crack version to bypass that anyway . if the uneasy individual be smart , they would sit back and read the news . however , if you do not want to risk that option , well refer back to my con as a protest against it . -lrb- 4 -rrb- finally , expansion to the game be probably go to happen at 49.95 a pop . then they will combine they and force a price tag of 49.95 for the whole set . then it will be all on one dvd in a few year with the full game . we know the store set the price but ea surely recommend a price . i would not waste my money on any future expansion pack . there be nothing they could do to the game to change the crap unless it change the whole ai engine and add much more need scripting . i be glad i do not buy the collector 's edition since wal-mart do not have at the time . my recommendation be to wait till the game be $ 10 buck .
401	Video_Games	NEG	1	-lrb- review edit -rrb- disappoint !!!!!!! the 1.4 patch have break the 360 . i dont know how many player have experience this but my game now lock up completely . im at level 57 and i cant progress any further . to make thing worse it corrupt my 360 and give it the rrod ... let i say i have no issue with my 360 performance prior to skyrim and the new patch . once i get my 360 repair i will not download any of the patch 's . i will play directly from the disc ... i will change my overall rating to 1 star . bethesda fix the ps3 issue but they break the 360 game ... shame on you bethesda you need to be put out of business for such poor patching of you own game ... \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
588	Video_Games	NEG	2	\* edit \* i previously be bash this product for not work , when it fact it be the ps2 controller that be at fault . it seem that error with a faulty controller be noticeable only on pc , but not noticeable when plug into a actual ps2 . if you have a button that be always light up when you try and change the button mapping , that be a sign that you will not be able to play you game because that loop button will override anything you try to do . for those of you that can not get vibration to work , there be driver at : -lrb- . . -rrb- under `` super dual box pro '' go into the control panel and change the setting - i test and the vibration work - but the program seem to crash upon closing and do not seem to be fully compatible with vista . overall , this product have work for i , and i have since change my review from 2 to 4 star . yay !
129	Video_Games	NEG	1	mass effect 3 be a very good game . it easily could have be the best in the series , if it do not fail so awfully in the last 10 minute . for such a minuscule percentage of the game , it be incredible how much it can ruin hundred of hour of fun span 3 game over 5 year . i really wish i could rate it higher , but i find it difficult if any thought i have of the mass effect series be about the end . to explain it without spoil anything , the final moment of the game make no sense , have nothing to do with anything you have do , and you final choice be very limit . that say , it be significantly likely the end do not actually happen , and be intend in it be current state , but because we do not know otherwise i can only review it at face value . if the extended cut validate that , this review will be a 5 star .
411	Video_Games	NEG	1	square enix have go downhill and never look back , 13 be indeed the biggest disappointment , i will keep this short and simple ... first of all , the story be too linear . i think it be okay , as long as story be good , but it isnt , it be overall very cliche and the story do not feel complete at all ... turn out square enix seem to be take the advantage of the exist fan base and plan to squeeze out more money from the player by make a sequel . second , character development , this be the first ff game that i can not find a lovable character . the character ' personality feel vague ... i cant help but think that square enix spend too much time on the graphic and totally forget to take care character development -lrb- this also apply to story as well -rrb- third , battle system , too simple , even a 10 year old can beat the game without a sweat . if i be to play a game for 30 + hour , and its story suck , character be dull , the gameplay experience better be good ... and square enix fail again some of you may think give it a 1 star be too harsh , but this be how disappointed i be ... i will not buy another ff game again ... sigh ...
903	Video_Games	NEG	1	the game itself be good enough . no complain on that . if you be listen ea , i will not buy another game with ea on it if you think origin be the future of your way of gaming .

'' because anytime you die , you have to sit through the npc 's idiotic dialog . -lrb- this be write by the red dawn guy ? no wonder he hasnt do anything else since the mid 80s ... -rrb- 4 you be force to wait for npc to catch up , you gun and ability to move be strip away routinely , multiple time per level , even in the middle of gun battle 5 there be a escort mission to protect a inanimate object ! 6 said inanimate object be some sort of amazing battle machine , comedically nonsensical for any suburban rebel force to have the capacity to equip or maintain . 7 i hate that the crouch\/duck button be not toggle-able . it be more like watch a interactive movie -- a lame one -- which occasionally let you participate in it . i be literally typing this while the game continue to run its course without i .
252	Video_Games	NEG	2	after play just dance 1 and 2 this game be below average . you do not know what move be come up and the music be not what i expect . when i take a zumba class they have popular\/upbeat music and this game do not . also , the remote do not stay in the belt very good and do not pick up the movement on the wius . i get more exercise with just dance and have much more fun in the process . i be look forward to just dance 3 in october .
17	Video_Games	NEG	1	we buy this for christmas think it would be fun for some family game time . we love the actual game but the video game be a joke . my husband who be very good at video game try two different challenge . you be require to do two different motion use the controller and nunchuck which prove to be very difficult . after try the training session for two different challenge -lrb- with not much success -rrb- we decide to return it to amazon . the challenge would be a lot more fun in real life than in a video game .
219	Video_Games	NEG	2	be a very fun game for the 4 year that i have play it , but i find myself in the past two year get bore of the game too quickly . i figure it be burnout , take a break , then come back 6 month later . nope still feel the same . come back this last time , and the community have just become abhorrent to deal with , new player can not get help throughout the barrage of attack in the trade channel . i do almost get to 84 but feel bore of it too fast , the graphic seem bland . -lrb- trees remind i or origami tree , no texture -rrb- water remind i of melt plastic . massive phase issue -lrb- have miner bot underground in area and steal mining nodes\/herb node -rrb- no police what so ever . deathw seem to be a non existent threat . several friend have quit since this expansion have come out , and i put my account on hold again , while cancel my daughter account . i think they be try to bring in new customer -lrb- per they report they could not get 70 percent of new account to make it past level 10 -rrb- which be great . they do need to bring in new blood . bad thing be that new blood be get rip apart by its own community . maybe it will change , more than likely not . perhaps blizzard grow too large ? bigger company do not always equal better . i just hope that when they do release diablo iii that it be not mess up , d2 be a tremendous blast to play .
911	Video_Games	NEG	2	i be a big fan of the civilization series , and pre-ordered my copy of civilization v hope it would be even better than the superb civilization iv . have play several game through to completion now , i have conclude that it be really pretty dull . the fundamental problem be that the game be too easy . a single-player strategy game like this be only as good as the computer opponent , and the one in civ v be pushover . i have play several game now at the highest difficulty level , try for various different victory condition , and win easily . i do not think this reflect on i be a superior player . i make lot of mistake . the issue be that the computer opponent do not play to win , or even to try and stop the human player from win . for example , there be one game where i could see that , be i to somehow switch place with one of the ai , i could win in a matter of just a few turn by spend its enormous trove of cash bribe city state to elect i world leader . the ai just sit there , do nothing in particular . in another game , i have target myself at win by build a spaceship and send it to alpha centauri . i see several other civilization achieve the prerequisite for build a spaceship ahead of i , and think maybe i be in trouble . but they do not even try to build they spaceship . and not because they be busy try to conquer the world , or win through some other mechanism . they pretty much just sit around . so i be able to eventually catch up and win again . there be also a lot of little thing about civilization v that i find annoying . for instance , there be the fact that you have no way of tell what the ai think of you or of each other , so war seem to happen at random . or the way you have to micromanage move you unit because the pathfinding be very poor . i could go on . combine these smaller issue with the overarching lack of a challenge , and it give the impression of a game that just be not design very well . i really want to like this game . and i think i give it a fair try . it be good enough to be engage for maybe a couple dozen hour , so by some folk 's standard i get my money 's worth . but i would have more fun if i would just keep play civilization iv , and i would recommend that game instead -lrb- or quite a few other -rrb- to anyone consider civilization v.

480	Video_Games	NEG	2	sid meier have get to the point in the gaming industry where all he have to do be attach he name to a game and it will sell . pirate ! be a game that offer so much promise , but it never really quite get there . yes , the game do provide i with several hour of enjoyment . the basic premise of the game be a blast . however , each goal in the game be accompanine by a mini-game . at first , the mini-game be nice easter egg , but they get very boring very fast . overall , the game need a lot of improvement . with a little tweaking , i believe pirates ! have the ability to become one of those game that define a genre . as it be , the game seem incomplete . the main quest never stop be enjoyable . the mini-game that must be accomplish in order to complete the main quest get unbearably tedious .
164	Video_Games	NEG	1	cod bo be a piece of crap ... it be the worst fp that i have ever own . its hacky and glitchy and not the least be consist . do not waste you money or you time
118	Video_Games	NEG	2	try play the game and the first time it start but could not figure out how to play it . a few day later try it again and steam refuse to work . no help from game maker . i will try one more time and see what happen if not will have to figure out how to sell it .
476	Video_Games	NEG	1	do not buy ! `` game party '' \* must \* be withdraw from sale . this game be make by warner brothers -lrb- wb -rrb- . they need to recall this game . those who buy it should be reimburse with a replacement of a new update game that work . please contact wb & xbox to inform they of the issue with this game so it never happen again . they need to play it for themselves so they can see that this game should never have been released in the first place . this be not a issue with the xbox console or kinect sensor - it be just this game . all the other kinect game work fine . wb & xbox must do something about this game . nearly all the review of this game be similar to my own experience . i just buy the xbox\/kinect this christmas . i choose xbox over the wii for much better graphic , resolution & gaming quality after have a ps2 for many year . i buy `` game party '' for the kid & family to have something other than violent shoot 'em up game . it be so frustrating just to get `` game party '' to work that nobody want to play it . it take i forever just to get into a game only to have it take i backward out of game repeatedly . often the go forward & backward would both submit at the same time . once i be finally in a game the tracking be bad & make the game unplayable . i really want this game to work because i love most all the 16 game in it . i hope xbox will come out with more arcade type game like this because we -lrb- even the kid -rrb- get too worn out with all the sport game . the ambulance be expensive to have on standby . warner brothers & xbox must do something about this game .
306	Video_Games	NEG	1	the reason i get this game be because of its overall concept of be able to explore a dangerous zone on earth . as i grow up in eastern europe , the atmosphere remind i at my experience during the communist era . i have play many fps game and recently finish f.e.a. r , doom 3 , hl2 , and far cry . the graphic , ai and overall game-play in s.t.a.l.k.e.r be pretty weak compare with any of the game mention above . the aus of the enemy be very poor , the game-play be cumbersome as you have to micromanage very many little detail , and read a lot of dialog text be annoying . during play , you will have to spend a large amount of time in inventory . the load time be very slow due to what it seem to be poor caching and memory management . the reason i believe that to be the case be that it even take a long time to go back to a recent quick-save . the slowness and other bug i encounter make i apply a patch that be release recently . the new patch break all my save game and i have to use a unlimited health trainer to speed up the process and get back to where i be . -lrb- waste about 2 hour -rrb- overall the game play be poor , and the support be terrible .
497	Video_Games	NEG	1	i get this for christmas , and i be so excited . i have be wait to get this game for a while and add it to my wishlist . my boyfriend buy it for i and i be so happy . i have to wait until all of the family and friend leave because i know that if this game be anything like the sims for the pc or any of the other sims game for console that i be go to be play for hour on end ... sadly it be the opposite . the game give almost no instruction , make a character be very difficult with the option and lagging , the wius system sound like it be try to eat the disc through the entire game ! -lrb- i be scare it might break the wius ! -rrb- the house building option be terrible and you do not really get to build you own home . you can only build inside the four wall they give you . this game be nothing like the original . i be hope for a easier way to see what my sim 's need be , but there be not . i have to pause the game to check constantly . when i enter the house after leave , the game stop to load every time ! when i try to read a book , the option be to `` read a book '' at random or `` open '' . after open i could move a book to my inventory or vice versa . so i have to move the book i want into the inventory . pause the screen to go to the inventory , and select the book . now i have to select the book in my sim 's hand and tell they to read it ... way to much work . the lagging make i impatient . and finally the game motion give i a huge headache . i do enjoy control the sim physically with the controller , but in the previous console game there be always the option to switch to the mode where you can build up a list of thing to do and you sim do they themselves . have to move each sim all around be very annoying . if i could give this game no star i definately would . too bad my bf get rid of the reciept . i would sell this for 5 buck if that . crap .
257	Video_Games	NEG	1	it control similar to doa game . just another button mashing game . sure the fan of the xbox will praise it cause this be one of the very very few game that carry the crap system besides halo . the game 's graphic be ok . nothing spectacular .  xbox suck
108	Video_Games	NEG	2	i be very excite to try out this new game because i love zumba class ! they do not always fit into my schedule , though , so i think i would give this a try so that i could dance when i have time . this game be not fun at all . normally , at least in the class i have be to , instructor try to incorporate some modern music into the dance session . this have only that moroccan style music mix in with some variation of a couple basic salsa move . i have a very difficult time get motivate by the game and end up just quit because it be so boring . what i be get at here , be spend you money go to a real zumba class or buy a dance workout on dvd . this be not worth the price !!
379	Video_Games	NEG	1	i wait a long time after release before buy this game , hope that the numerous bug would have be work out . unfortunately it still crash constantly , and once you have a corrupt save game you be screw . if it work right it might be a good game .
98	Video_Games	NEG	1	this game have mad system requirement . when i buy it , i have to upgrade my video card so that it would support shader 3.0 -lrb- the game doesnt look that fine trust i , it would have run on 2.0 perfectly , developer be just alienate 2.0 user -rrb- . anyway , after upgrade to a really expensive video card , i have great expectation , i mean , a game that have 3.0 shader as a minimum system requirement have to look awesome right ? well no , it look exactly like any other game i ever play on my 2.0 shader card . on top of that , the game be buggy as hell and really boring when compare with the other splinter cell titles . my final recommendation ? get those bill you be go to use to pay for it and burn they , much more fun in that than this stupid game .
382	Video_Games	NEG	2	the only reason i continue to play to story mode of tron : evolution be to gain the story itself . it set up a critical point that in the story which the movie mention . this be not a game about the movie , but rather a prequel to it . in keep with the movie however , the word be pretty , although very similar and tiresome by a hour in . that be say , that be basically where the positive thing end . the game be you basic `` button smasher '' with little thought behind what you be do . you simply have to figure out which disk to throw at you enemy . that be the extend of the though require for this game most of you time play this game will be spend go back over thing you have do over and over . the camera angle and poor movement result in you be `` derezz '' far too often , and you will find yourself go repeat the same section of the stage several time until you move ahead . this be not due to a lack of skill amongst any player , but rather the glitchiness of the game itself . this game be a rent at best
266	Video_Games	NEG	1	i buy a sharpshooter , a mini controller -lrb- whatever they be call -rrb- really only to play with this game . they do not work . at all . so , 2 star off for that . at least with kz3 you can fully customize how the move \/ sharpshooter work , with this -lrb- as far as what happen when you hit the iron sight button -rrb- you just can not . and it do not work . in short , do not even consider use this with a sharpshooter . i have really try to make it work , but no luck . once you hit the ironsight -lrb- zoom -rrb- button , forgehdaboudit . also , this be a completely different game than res 1 and 2 . and , the problem be , that i really like resistance 1 and 2 . the two player split screen be horrible . it split you tv in half horizontally -lrb- the opposite of res 1 -rrb- and it just come off feeling cramp . very uncomfortable . res1 work perfectly , no clue why they feel the need to change it . also -lrb- spoiler ? -rrb- : -rrb- let i ruin the game for you : every scene go like this . where be we suppose to go ? ahhh ! too many monsters ! ! ! ! they be all dead ? ok . . where do i go next ? whereas res 1 and 2 have you choose cover and take enemy out with headshot -lrb- my style -rrb- this be monster monster bum rush bum rush constantly . some people might call it `` intense '' . . i call it `` overwhelming-to-the-point-of-constant-frustration . '' -lrb- really ? i get hit by the 10 monster behind i because i be shoot the 20 monster in front of i ? yeah . . that be fair ! -rrb- : -rrb- my son and i be try to get through it , but tonight even he say . . `` wow , this game just be not very good , be it . . '' so , 1 star off for . . not match up to the joy that be 1 and 2 . finally , 1 more star off for this : the swearing . i know it be not for kid , neither be 1 or 2 . . but there be -lrb- comparably -rrb- very little swearing in 1 and 2 . plus , 1 and 2 be so good you could `` forgive '' it here and there . . this be not a very good game and it be back up by a annoying sound track of cuss word for no reason . boo . so , here end another 1 star review . keep in mind i purchase many other product and game and be quite happy with they -lrb- and usually do not review they as there be enough positive review out there for you to read and help in you decision make . -rrb- i tend to only post review when i feel that the other side really need to be say in case you be try to make a purchase decision . in this case , i would highly recommend a rent or wait until you can get it use for 30 , especially if you be not into multiplayer like i . mho .
184	Video_Games	NEG	1	1 . it be incredibley hard to move aroundd . 2 . you cant explore -lrb- you just choose what level you want -rrb- 3 . they cant even jump ! what fun be that ? 4 . it give my computer lot of virus 5 . dont waste yor money on this i save up for it and i regret it 100 %
369	Video_Games	NEG	1	so i buy spore on open day , i would be excite about it for age , and while it have not quite live up to my expectation , it have still be a fun game to play , until today . i run it on a laptop , which be usually plug into a wire , but occasionally i go wireless with it and sit on the couch to play . today for some reason my wireless do not come up , and i do not notice . i be happily play spore , when suddenly the game exit on i with a pop up from the ea downloader that say ` please check you internet connection , you seem to be disconnect ' . no chance to save , no auto save , no warning , no nothing . game quit , the end , sorry if you lose datum . i really really wish i could get my $ 50 back .

725	Video_Games	NEG	1	stay far far away from this game . this be one of the worst mmorpg game i have play this decade . the ui be horrible , lag be bad , no auction house , can not invite someone into a party unless you stand next to he , wait 36 hour to do quest suck , no automatic battle so you have to spam the 1 key . i usually do not write any review for a game but this game be so bad that i wish it will die in 3 month just like apb mmorpg .

430	Video_Games	NEG	2	the graphic be not that bad , the video be not bad either , but like what everyone say before , this game have stuff that make no sense . like the developer leave out the little detail . for example , for the task , one person will ask you to clean out `` comet 's stall '' but the person never say which of the , what , maybe 10 stall stable be comet 's . same with be ask to take someone else 's horse to pasture . . i later notice he horse look the same as the horse i choose on the second level . so many glich as well . for example , it will not let i let go of the horse , or let i put the horse in its stall , drive i nut ! its ashamed because the game have so much potential . it just need to be more user friendly and logical .
694	Video_Games	NEG	2	i have play both sims 1 and sims 2 on my pc for year . i be not able to get sims 3 for my pc because my pc be not up-to-date . when i see that sims 3 be come to console , i be thrill . i could now play the sims 3 . i do like be able to go anywhere within the neighborhood without have extremely long load time -lrb- compare to v. 1 & 2 -rrb- . i also like the opportunity that you sim can take advantage of . i have enjoy play this over the last couple of day . however , today be my first chance to dedicate a decent amount of time to this game . i do have some complaint regard this version game . the book be confuse . you have to keep they in inventory and then select they from inventory in order to read one . there be a glitch here . as soon as you select anything from inventory , a menu pop up but do not have say item -lrb- like a book -rrb- among the choice . you have to cancel by hit you b button and then hit select , the a button , all over again . i can not tell where my sim be in he or she relationship with someone . there be no number and the bar in the relationship panel look the same for all the sims . there be also no explanation about what some of the object do like there be for the pc game -lrb- such as which of the kid toy be educational -rrb- . -lrb- though for i , this be a minor thing . -rrb- i do not realize there be no fireman -lrb- i be lucky enough not to have a fire -rrb- , as i read on another review , but do see there be no way to hire a maid , butler , or nanny . these be all available from day 1 on the sims for the pc and be even advertise in one of the video for the console game . where be they ? what would happen if my family have kid ? i have only be able to have my sim do one thing at a time because of the way they have choice set up . also , if i have more than one sim in the family , there be problem . if , for example , i have sim # 1 cook a meal , and then i select sim # 2 and have they workout , sim # 1 will sometimes stop what he\/she be do . i have even see the unselected sim wander all around town just to go to the bathroom . be this a problem with sim 3 for the pc ? i do not know as this be my first experience with sim 3 . my biggest complaint seem like the biggest `` glitch . '' after a few hour of game play , there be problem with the neighbor -- all of they . at first i think it be only the neighbor my sim meet , but then i start a new game and be careful about who they meet , but then i see neighbor my sim never meet in they own yard `` scream '' because they all need to use the toilet ! neighbor die for unknown reason ! one neighbor be invite over to my sims house . he raid the fridge and promptly go to bed to sleep . he die before he wake up ! try to have a relationship of any kind with one of the neighbor and you have better make sure to invite they over all the time so they can get they need fulfil . after all , you be just start `` life as a sim '' and do not have enough karma point to save they all !! i have another sim who be a romantic . he build a relationship with one neighbor and do not have she over for 2 day while work on another . this `` lady '' die the next day . this game ought to have a lifetime goal of humanitarian because you sim will be too busy try to keep all he or she friend and neighbor from die to do anything else ... or just let they all die ???? ever since the sims 2 come out , this game , at least for i , turn into a game of create generation from the first sim you create . this do not seem possible with the console version of sims 3 . my biggest concern be how will these problem with the game get solve ? will they get solve ? or have i just blow my money ? in the past with the pc sims game , patch be available for download . can the same be do for wii ?

327	Video_Games	NEG	1	wow i have really like the work out game , the sport game , and the adventure game so for for kinect . but this one ... what a epic fail ! this game be the one that will seldomly get play . thank god they do not bundle it with the kinect or i would have take it back to the store the day i get it . horrible motion tracking and control during game play , it be at a level far below any of the other kinect game . you will be disappoint if you buy this . i really have high hope because i want to play beer pong and bean bag toss with my friend when we party at my place . it have a lot of game but they be all so frustrating to control .
12	Video_Games	NEG	2	i enjoy part 2 and enjoy part 3 even more with the exception of the end and a key function . i love the graphic and game gameplay with this exception ; if you be near a hiding spot and you try to sprint from the enemy at that very spot , the game 's sprint function will choose to hide you right before the enemy , instead of sprint which cause the enemy to kill you . i really hope that that be not you most innovative thinking oh great e. a\/bioware . be you tell i you could not assign a single key for sprint ? there be so many top of the line game available today all with they specific sprint key and for some deep scientific reason you could not have put that function in me3 ? now i truly try to appreciate a game , a story or movie for what it be , but bioware and e.a just finish the job of ruin whatever remain liking i have for they base on what they have do to this game . the end make so sence what-so-ever . and despite so many person request for a better ending , the smart creator declare ` no we be not change it , it be fineeeeeeee the way it be . ' do you know that idiocracy be not right but rather a choice ? and to think they be ask so much money for it hah . to i it be as if they be work tirelessly to destory they fan base with these sort of foolish action . and then they complain that they have to sell the game for outrageous price with foolish excuse . really ? do sensible thing with the game and people will gladly buy it at a premium price point $ 25 - $ 35 . you will end up build you rep and fan base , and make you money in the process . so many thing about the game do not add up or do not make sence . now if that be what the game creator be try to achieve then man they stick gold . after play the single player i be like ` that be it , break the door down kronk . ' if i could have return the game after play it then i would not even bother write a review as i could get my money back -lrb- even if i get less than what i pay -rrb- . but , these same game creator defend the right before the govt that they be lose $ $ when the consumer do not keep the software -lrb- result = no return open software -rrb- . why do not you make what the consumer will want to keep , then everyone would be happy ? you complain you do not collect $ $ on the sale of use product and i guess that make you feel cheated . what about the consumer who have invest they time and money into you product only to feel cheat ? you do not want to give they back a dime but you want to continue collect ? i will give you this , i have learn from this game experience that i be not buy any more game until i see a walkthrough for it . if i like it then i will buy it . no more will i listen the you advertising , i will listen to other gamer . and by then the game should cost less so it be a win win situation for i . since i already own the game i only play the multiplayer which be another story , but it be -lrb- in my view -rrb- still better than what they give as a end for the single player . never again e. a\/bioware , never again !
849	Video_Games	NEG	1	when we get just dance 2 , we whole family be excite . we have love and music and move in just dance . we open and have some friend over and put it in . the music be `` lame '' accord to the kid and not as much fun . we still use it and it be play but there be just not as much excitement for just dance 2 .
456	Video_Games	NEG	2	honestly i be so excited to get this game and it be such a let down , maybe the wii version be different but most of the time , the `` trainer '' could not see my arm . i change room , lighting , clothing and get the same result everytime . also the game lock up a couple of time and lose all info that i have ever exercise . the trainer would ask which area i want to target , no matter which body part i choose , the routine be always the same . great idea , need alot more work !
301	Video_Games	NEG	1	take a page from stardock 's playbook - no drm - treat you customer as they deserve .
799	Video_Games	NEG	1	worst game ever . this game be horrid . you can drive truck off the map , into white nothingness , and you can drive through building . not to mention the fact that you can not drive over bridge -lrb- you truck fall through the bridge -rrb- . to call this one of the worst game ever would be give it too much credit . accord to the box , you have to evade the law and deliver you goods . the thing be , there be no police officer to evade and no goods to deliver . the only thing you do be race against a ai opponent that never leave the start line . yep , it be true . when you start a game , the ai opponent who be suppose to race against you , just sit there at the start line for the whole race . you be winner ! the game scream that at you when you finish a race against the nonexistant opponent . the only `` human '' who could enjoy this game be a dumb 2-year old who be instantly amaze at truck drive off the road . stay away from this game at all cost . you be winner !
359	Video_Games	NEG	2	first : this be not a original sony controller !! you can see it and you feel it , when you play with it . over all its ok , for this price !!
847	Video_Games	NEG	2	there be not much more to it -- it be the ` introductory game ' to the playstation move equipment . be the game fun to play ? yup . do they get boring very quickly once you figure they out ? yup . ... which be why you can buy this use or online for under 10 buck . i actually enjoy bocce more than any other game , to my surprise ... while ping pong be very physical , which be fun . beach volleyball be too limited to give a ` real ' feeling , and archery take a few round to figure out -- jury 's still out on what i think of it . overall it be a good starter to get you into the move equipment , before you move onto other stuff .
435	Video_Games	NEG	1	we have prisoner of azkaban for the pc . it be a much better game than this one . you be actually allow to use the mouse , unlike in gof ! we also have the order of the phoenix for wii . that be get it be problem too , but at least the game be write with that platform in mind - this game be simply a playstation game plop onto a pc platform . ugh . buy azkaban instead , and do not waste you money on this one .
506	Video_Games	NEG	2	it be definitely a cinematic game , but that be its biggest downfall . it be impossible to simply pick-up-and-play this game ; be ready to dedicate at least a hour to this game if you hope to play for twenty minute . for those look for a game , and not a movie , buy a game , instead of metal gear solid 4 . it be that easy !
856	Video_Games	NEG	1	the graphic and gameplay be absolutely stunning even on low . that if you can get to that part . this game be very hard to handle . during my time with this product i have encounter white screen of death -lrb- game freeze with a white screen -rrb- , key in use error and so much more . it be almost impossible to get to the good stuff . during the campaign at the end of the first mission i encounter a white screen which make i restart my computer . them when i give up try to finish the campaign due to all the white screen i attempt multiplayer . that do not work out either . i try over 20 time to enter my game key on my ea account but apparently it be already in use . also because ea have horrible customer support for it be game i do not recomend this game for the pc . any other platform it work fine . i myself have play it on xbox360 and ps3 and it be incredible . for pc not so much especially with all the hassle i have to go through to get the game to work . i end up return my copy for pc . it be a waste of my time to attempt play this on the pc .
957	Video_Games	NEG	1	i be actually plan on pick this up today . but i be not go to buy it now , at least until they remove the drm . by then i probably will not care any more anyway .
482	Video_Games	NEG	1	this game be great fun as long as you like make content and then watch it on screen . the game play be very simplistic . cell stage game play be a flash game with pretty graphic . creature stage be like diablo but water down with very few ability and repetitive game play . tribal and civ stage be akin to rts game , but lack the depth and variety of game such as sin of a solar empire or warcraft 3 . space stage be basically the first few stage over and over but with a space ship throw in . this be say i really do like playing . create a creature\/building\/vehicle , and then watch it do its thing be very satisfying . bottom line , if you like goof off and play with spore like a toy its fun . however if you be look for a deep combat system , complex rt strategy develop , or think provoke game play this game be not for you . the simplistic game play couple with outrageous drm and the ea sporepedium server be very buggy -lrb- will not upload some creature -rrb- , this game need lot of work to be a fun game . the editor be already fantastic . stage need to be flesh out with more abilities\/vehicles\/strategy \/ etc. . drm need to be do away with or make less crazy -lrb- 3 install you be basically rent the game for 50 usd -rrb- securom need to be do away with -lrb- it kill a cd rom drive on a old pc of mine . for the average gamer i would say stay away for now or wait for bargain bin price .
876	Video_Games	NEG	1	whatever you do do not buy this its just a fake ps3 conntroller . go ahead and save you money and do not waste on this controller the analog stick be to solid to move and all button be to hard when press on  playstation 3 dualshock 3 wireless controller -lrb- classic white -rrb-
464	Video_Games	NEG	1	the hype for this game mainly center around its gripping story pen by john milius , which would lead one to believe the single player game would be amazing . do not believe the hype . i purchase the dvd , and it require a 12 -lrb- ! -rrb- hour download before i could play . next , i find that the single player game be over in about 4 hour . 4 hour ! so , write by john milius ? okay , maybe he write it on a napkin during he lunch break . seriously , there be some great potential here that will never be realize . i think i 'll go watch red dawn .
584	Video_Games	NEG	1	1 . graphics well , the water effect and some screen dynamics be pretty cool . however , they fail to mitigate the horrendous appearance of npc . literally , each male character 's facial feature look no better than the one from medal of honor : allied assault . the texture and geometry be pretty dull even when render in the highest setting . the most atrocious aspect of dnf 's graphic be far-sight blur : background and object far away from the player be render with severe blurriness like you be watch a 3d movie . i have no idea what gearbox be think when they implement this feature , since it certainly exacerbate the overall look of the game . maybe they mean to blur out the weapon while duke be iron-sighting ? 2 . ridiculous ai no pun intend , i think the original game have better aus than this one . some lethargic enemy will hide behind box container during a freeway battle , and will not come out till you approach they . one time , i be downstairs directly below some piggy on a balcony , they keep throw grenade upstairs as if i be there . well , they be suppose to be retard , but still they should not be try to obliterate each other with they own grenade when they foe be actually downstairs . 3 . this game be just not duke nukem to the people say `` do not expect this game to be mw2 '' : then why can duke hold only 2 gun at a time and he have a self-recharging health bar ? i understand gearbox be probably force to follow today 's fp trend in some degree , but this be just not duke nukem . you could hold multiple weapon and you health do not regenerate in bioshock , but it turn out to be a fantastic game . i wish gearbox have create a game with much of its own characteristic , instead of engender a collage of well-known successful game , such as mw2 , halflife , halo , quake , etc -lrb- seriously ? a railgun in duke nukem ? give i a break ! -rrb- dnf do not exhibit much originality . gearbox attempt to copy-paste some of nostalgic feature from the original game , and then some of the distinct feature from each of the game i have mention . no card key , no jetpack , no mighty-foot engage the brawl ... many of the characteristic you expect this game to inherit from its predecessor be unfortunately absent . 4 . each battle become very repetitive there be only a few type of enemy . i will not bother enumerate they all , but there be about 10 minion type if i remember correctly . they be either from the original game or from halflife series : some bug from hl2ep2 , the big monster wield with hive-hand gun . in the original game , the player have plenty of chance to exult in confront some of the most creative enemy . not in this game . even the boss battle become tepid after the first 30 seconds . 5 . the atmosphere of the game except for a few level , you 'll spend nearly the entire game in dark and gloomy hallway , mostly do closed-space combat . it resemble quake 4 rather than the original duke nukem game . just like mw2 , each map be extremely linear . there be not many explorable area divert from a main route of each level . at least mw2 have some memorable moment or transition in mission objective while you be follow the main route . in dnf , there be some cut-scene in between . that be all . 6 . conclusion although the game evince some of gearbox 's painstaking effort to create detailed and interactive component -lrb- such as pinball machine , the strip club , airhocky , etc -rrb- , this game be conclusively a epic failure . not much originality , the game become repetitive after the first few level , you probably will not even know what to say when you see its meaningless 30-second ending . i strongly suggest you wait till the price of this game drop down to $ 19.99 . consider the quality of the game , it should not take very long for dnf to become that cheap .
253	Video_Games	NEG	1	ea have lose i as a customer . since when do buy a product mean you cant use it forever . i have have to reformat my hard drive over three time and i do it on a regular basis to have a fresh os . now i be tell that i will no longer be able to do that and install this game over 3 time ??? this be spore , they will make million off of this game and have no reason to worry about copyright infringement all at the cost of the customer who actually do buy the game . i be very frustrated and extremely disappointed .
845	Video_Games	NEG	2	harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban could have be a mediocre game . there be some strong point , such as fly buckbeak and great graphic , but there be so many thing that be surpass by the chamber of secret that this game be at best only a vain attempt to live up the previous game . the story be almost entirely tell not by the player but by the cutscene have the same problem with the related movie : overacting -lrb- facial expression be wayyy too dramatic and character voice be overdue -rrb- . the character be annoy with they goofy movement and good-for-nothing line , and i could not care less if my character be kill in the middle of the mission . the gameplay be smooth , though , but not as good as in the chamber of secret -lrb- e.g. harry can not run around and cast spell at the same time -rrb- . the level be far less creative and complex than the one in the previous game , and the number of they be even more pathetic . with just two non-class level , i suddenly find near the end of the game . overall , this game make the player do a number of semi-related stuff without make they feel be a actual part of the game . it be much simpler , to be sure , but do that really matter ? i beat the game within 24 hour -lrb- i repeat , 24 hour for a person who have serious problem play jedi outcast -rrb- , and i feel far less satisfied than i be when i complete other harder game . i do not think i really care about play as hermione or ron , either because the character be really annoying , or this be just a bad game . i be really happy when i just play as harry in the previous game .
259	Video_Games	NEG	1	good game , but annoying and intrusive copy protection . when will publisher learn not to punish honest customer ?
61	Video_Games	NEG	2	first off , my computer be three year old . it be a reasonably high end computer in its day as well . but this release be also three year old , so it \* should \* run fine . it do not . it crash often . unless i turn all the graphic way down it run verry slowly . in contrast , unreal tournament 2004 with its flashy graphic and sound run fine on my computer . the level design be not great , but the enemy aus be worse . sometimes you can shoot a line of baddy one at a time with a sniper rifle and they will not budge . stay away from microsoft if you can .
68	Video_Games	NEG	1	it be obvious that spore be no longer the most wanted game this year . i originally buy spore for a friend , who incidentally do not have a internet connection , and be unable to even install the game because of it . because of this , i give he another game in exchange for spore . i should have just refund he , as spore tend to be extremely boring , simplistic , and buggy . the reason that mainstream reviewer be unable to put spore into any particular genre of game be because spore 's game play be so simple . this simplicity make spore feel like a `` fisher price : my first video game '' more than anything . most stage be mercifully short , until you reach the space phase , where you can fly around in you very own spaceship and rule the galaxy . sound great , do not it ? unfortunately , it be not . in order to get any worthwhile tool or weapon , you need to gain sporebucks -lrb- the form of currency in spore -rrb- from quest and you fellow alien . this eventually put world of warcraft 's grind to shame , as you gain little reward and constantly have to defend you neighbor planet from pirate attack and `` ecodistaster '' , which considerably slow you progress . one of spore 's more tout feature be share you creation with other people , and be the reason spore be sometimes -lrb- incorrectly -rrb- call a `` massively multiplayer online singleplayer game '' ; this name could not be farther from the truth . call spore a mmosg be like say , `` fighting custom bot in unreal tournament count as you fight a real person , even if the skin be purely cosmetic ! a real person make the skin , so it count ! '' as such , put custom creature into spore be just another waste of space , due to the fact that you can not even configure what ship they should get or what they personality should be . it should also be note that there be several aspect of spore that be cut from the game -lrb- but still reside in the game 's code -rrb- . for example , it be possible to see many extra cell part by change you spore shortcut -lrb- the flora editor be still in as well , but be unstable beyond use -rrb- . as nice as extra stuff sound , it be impossible to actually use any of this . spore also have several glitch that be extremely annoying , such as planet merely appear as gray globe until you enter they . be unable to make backup save file be also a issue , as you will be unable to restore you save should it become corrupt like mine do . spore 's drm be also a huge problem , but this be probably cover in the 2000 + negative review . all in all , spore be a waste of money , computer space , and time . i strongly urge fellow gamer to stay away from this game . i do not see spore 's expansion pack sell very well . if you absolutely must get spore or any expansion pack , i suggest you listen to the pirate .
295	Video_Games	NEG	1	the base that the kinect attach to do not securely fit into the mount , i.e. , it wobble around a lot and once the kinect be add to it . the kinect then can not move in its full range to calibrate because the base be not stable until i mess with it for 5 minute try to get it into a `` stable '' position . this work for a while until it move again and the kinect can no longer move in its full range of motion . irritating and just plain junky . maybe mine be a dud .
54	Video_Games	NEG	2	imagine , if you will , that you be run a marathon . imagine that you have spend year training for that day , put you heart and soul and energy into it . now , imagine that the day of the marathon , you loved one be there cheer you on . that feeling of joy and pride wash over you as you take off , every mile pump you adrenaline , force you to go on . and you feel good . no. . . you feel satisfied ! finally , the end be in sight ! the finish line be just on the horizon ! you push and you run . it get closer and closer . you be now ten yard away ! finally , the feeling of accomplishment you will feel when you cross that line will finally come ! and then , at the very last minute , someone leap from the crowd and cripple both you kneecap with a softball bat ... that be what the experience of mass effect 3 be . until the very last moment , the game seem nearly perfect . the atmosphere , gameplay , and story seem to be everything we have be wait for in order to complete commander shepard 's story . but then , you hit the last ten minute and it be a slap in the face . after you watch the final -lrb- nonsensical -rrb- cutscene , you feel as if you have be betray and from that point on , the game no longer have any replay value whatsoever . i love mass effect 3 but now all that stick out in my mind be that terrible end . it be difficult to say anything else that have not already be say . when the game be good , it be great and then it pull the chair out from under you at the very last minute .
745	Video_Games	NEG	2	i agree 100 % , two step backwards , total waste of money . i feel like i just spend $ 60 on a really long , boring movie that let you pretend you in it for a while . never should have let infinity ward go , treyarch suck . 1 : the soundtrack , `` cut to '' scene and the sound quality make i feel like i be play the original playstation one , aweful , just aweful , it be like they know they could make this game for 10 cent a pop and sell it for 60 buck . 2 : graphics and story be sub-par , and remind i of the trailer ; spotty , flashy and over all too soon , but then there more , then more , then more , and you leave there wonder when you actually get to play the game instead of watch unemotional scene of spit the f word at shadow in a office while tie to a chair . they should have add a trophy for nausea : realize that when a game only take 50 mb its because there be no game . 3 : zombie co-op : see as how they leave infinity ward in the dark on this one , there be no local co-op awesomeness this time ... just overdo zombie level ... snooze ... it be funny and interesting for all of twenty minute . even though it be a okay zombification of the game there be only one difficulty level and well ... it be be do , so ... way to beat a dead horse , lol . 4 : multiplayer : so you can modify you own personal tag for online play ... cricket ... cricket ... its the exact same online as mw2 , with a few small ` nobody care ' change , that could have be make to mw2 with a free patch . why do everyone defend this game base on its multiplayer , that be just beyond i . what could have be a free patch , just cost 60 dollar to a lot of gamer , and right before the release of two game company actually spend time on need for speed : hot pursuit and gran turismo 5 . 5 : i would re-price this at 19.99 if i personally be involve in the selling of it .
671	Video_Games	NEG	2	on a whim i pick this up year ago and enjoy it , although it be a bit easier on the difficulty-side , a little more frustrating , and much slower paced than its origin , i neglect these petty and trivial complaint at the time . unfortunately it come back to haunt i , as i feel severely underwhelm by my first few minute back in it once again . `` oh look ! its a game that could never have stand on its own without the original and actually look worse now -lrb- due to that new fangled 3d engine at the time do not age so well after window 98 era hardware -rrb- than the first freaking game . '' basically if you love the series to death - pick it up for sure . however , if you realize that the spark of ingenuity , originality , humor and atmosphere -lrb- which be all coincidentally miss from the sequel -rrb- have suddenly wander off with old age - do not bother . in fact just keep sign useless petition for another sequel that ea will never make as its not a cash-cow ip these day and never be .
491	Video_Games	NEG	2	never do i own a game before that require steam . to play the game you have to log into steam to launch . so why do i buy a dvd and get force to use steam ? shortly after join steam so i could play since i already open the package and could not return it now i get a notice from steam that they have be hack and may have lose customer information . that really give i the warm and fuzzy . as far as the game it actually load on windows 7 x64 unlike fallout 3 that work fine on vista but would not load when i upgrade . the mouse movement and graphic seem really jerky . i try to use a xbox 360 wireless controller only to find out i need a $ 20 adapter . so i try a pc joystick and i do not seem to do anything ... as far as gameplay , it have not manage to keep i envolve . i keep walk away and come back later . i have just find my way to the keep after have to repeat the open many time . at the moment i have to call it disappointing hopefully i 'll make it thru all the intial b and learn to like the game ... just may take a while ...
961	Video_Games	NEG	2	the xbox 360 afterglow controller be not worth the money . it have a different feel to it than the original xbox 360 controller . my original xbox 360 controller break , and i have to get a new one . i see that this be only $ 30 at gamestop . do not be fool by the cheap price . the controller be more bulky than the original , and it almost feel like you play a ps3 controller . the only thing that cool about this controller be the tiny led light install into the hardware of the controller . they can stay on , light up when the controller vibrate , sort of make a strobe light effect , or u can just turn it off . if you play a first person shooter , take mw2 for example , you will find that the right joystick be not as sensitive as the original , or do it move as calmly as the original . if you play gta iv , the left trigger will aim down the sight , but wont lock onto target unless you really push the trigger down . it be the same for the right trigger . so what do i think of this product ? i think if microsoft make it the controller from the same body design as the original xbox 360 controller , it would be better . if you need a replacement controller , or just wanna get another one , -lrb- unless you into led light in a controller -rrb- just buy a white controller . do not waste you money with this , it be not worth it

7	Video_Games	NEG	1	not really a lot to say here . the graphic be actually spectacular . that be why it get the one star . the game itself be utter nonsense and absolute crap . i have see people get through it in as little as a bit over a hour , i take my time and get 3 out of it . nothing really here at all to offer to anyone who be a fan of drive game , unless you like the walmart arcade racer in the arcade area . then this would be right up you alley . the physics , as with all nfs game since ... the first few original , be absolutely ridiculous . the car themselves be gorgeous , but behave nothing like car . ea gamble it be entire game on be the only one to offer porsches , due to a contract game like forza 4 , be not allow to use porsches . well , this strategy be a absolute , utter failure . it will never compete with game like forza 3 or 4 , or gran turismo . i can not imagine it be really mean to though , it feel like they spend all of about 5 minute develop it . i suppose i be a bit harsh . i just like my drive game to feel like i be actually drive something . honestly , any drive game without a interior view automatically lose all star . this game have no real story , no real substance to it , but like i say , graphically it be honestly pretty awesome . as for judge if you should buy it or not , go to you local walmart , play one of those `` fast and the furious '' arcade game . if you like it , this be for you . if you be look for anything resemble actual driving , do not bother , honestly . at least not at the price it be be sell for now . when it drop to the 5 dollar value box , or if you be go to rent it , go for it . mercifully , i be smart enough to play before buying . do the world a favor and do not give ea or black box any of you money . let evolution take it be course .
63	Video_Games	NEG	1	i puchase this product so that i could download netflix from market place . i have trouble with it from day one , and have not be able to resolve the issue . the red light stay on solid and then it go out and its own . my xbox be not the issue , it work fine with everything else . very disappoint .
127	Video_Games	NEG	1	bf3 be a very generic shooter with up-to-date graphic and sound . single player mode be simply junk , multi-player mode lack all the feature that make , for example , bf2 so much fun : shooter combine with great teamwork , tactic and strategy . single player : you be a actor play a very rigid and linear script . you be tell all the time what to do , there be nothing to explore , no choice on how to perform you task . you simply need to follow the step by step direction , until you die , at which point you restart from a few step back . actually you do have some liberty : you can choose the order in which you can kill the enemy present to you . i can recall many game from 20 year ago , that would fit on a single floppy disk and that be much more exit . multi-player : i will compare it mostly with bf2 : there be no more teamwork . not at squad level and certainly not at team level . there be no more voip in game . if you plan to hook up with some random people in the game and play and chat for a couple hour in a squad , bad luck . it will be just plain silent shooting , and wonder what the squad mate do and think . no easy way to communicate . all weapon work very well at long range - so everything become a matter of discover the adversary at long range in the very cluttered environment . if you move , you will almost certainly be kill by someone hide somewhere . the map be very large , which mean that unless you play long hour you will be continuously confuse by you location and where you killer might be . there be no more commander ! so no more unity as a team , no more direction and unify strategy - at least not easily if you join a random server . no more asset such as radar , artilery , uav . the user interface : again bf2 be mile ahead , simple easy to use , instantly understandable . bf3 : clutter , annoy in short , save you money ! if you like bad company 2 you might like this one as well , but if you be a bf2 fan for the reason enumerate in the first paragraph , than bf3 will be a waste of money . real waste , since of course one can not resell the game - it will become tie to you ea origin account . i certainly regret order it in advance , instead of wait for the first unbiased review .
608	Video_Games	NEG	1	this be the first and will be the last securom product i 'll ever buy . the game start off good enough , but eventually just become tedious and pointless . give it to the local thrift shop while there be still a activation or two leave . i 'll include a note that the drm stuff will soon make it worthless . might be worth pay a buck for .
296	Video_Games	NEG	1	i have be pay for and play ea game for over two decade now . i be sick and tired of the larger publisher force these draconian measure to combat piracy on lawful pay customer . there have to be a better way . see stardock 's gamer 's bill of rights , please . no spore for this gamer .
110	Video_Games	NEG	1	i be 59 year old and have be use computer extensively for over 35 year . i buy the ps3 to play br disc and to watch netflix . the ps3 user interface be horrible . i have to guess and use trial & error to try to use the unit . most all older americans will never be able to use it . i be recommend to my friend to get a ps3 for netflix . now i do not . the password hassle , update screw up , the sony store want all we personal information before we can even use the unit be just too much of a waste of time . i go to the sony website to get more operating instruction . you know the instruction be poor if after they , they still have a list of `` hint '' to try to help you complete a seemingly easy task . i think the ps3 be probably a good machine , but dos be easier to use . rewrite the user interface , or add a additional new one , if you want to ever gain more market share .
113	Video_Games	NEG	1	i buy the hard copy version -lrb- with the cd and case and whatnot -rrb- and i be still force to download the game through origin and that be after a hour of customer support try to figure out why . so now i be stare at 2 perfectly good and useless cd -lrb- with about 8 gig of info on they -rrb- while -lrb- accord to origin -rrb- it will take 9 hour for the download to complete and then i be not even sure if i can run it . such a disappointment . this game be start on such a lousy note that i be not even sure i be look forward to play it .
474	Video_Games	NEG	1	i can not believe they release this - so far , maybe 5 hour into try to make it work , i can find no server and play single player there be lot of problem , especially if you try to use a joystick . worse , the support site be just awful - without the user community , i would have no idea how to solve the problem i be see .
841	Video_Games	NEG	1	i love play the first 3 myst game back when i have a pc but have since change to a mac laptop i have search for game i could play on it . i think that because the game say mac for operate system it would play but it do not work on my laptop so if you be a mac user and interested in this game check closely what operate system you 's have and see which mac system this game will play on .
319	Video_Games	NEG	2	great concept and conception , but need further development . first of all , if you be leave handed , you should stop read this . this product be not for you . it be advertise as be ambidextrous . but the left thumb stick would need to be handle with you right hand . you -lrb- and you brain -rrb- will spend too much time try to adjust to the conflict of a regular dual shock controller . second , i be amaze to read how many people state that this device , with the move controller attach , be `` accurate '' . it be far from it and be well document -lrb- do a search on the iwaggle3d review -rrb- . you can not calibrate the sight to point straight , ever . there be a drift on the target ... it move `` off-center '' from the sharp shooter . re-calibrating in-game or with the ps3 utility do not fix this issue . this be why the `` sight '' attachment plan be postpone . so `` aim down the rail '' be impossible at the moment . the most accurate would be the wius remote and nunchucku combo `` zapper '' or use light gun technology such as guncon to get pinpoint aim . next ... this product be make more for the `` casual '' gamer . any hardcore gamer would be too lazy to do this for hours\/days\/months \/ year other than to give it a try -lrb- look up the truth b tell show review -rrb- . just like the wius and the kinect be cater to the occasional gamer , so be this . and for that , it be a nice peripheral . it be mean to be use as comfortable as possible ... from the shoulder or the hip instead of eye level . size ... it be way too bulky . again , it be ok for the casual gamer . but if you be sit down , it will always get in the way , especially the butt stock , even with it detract all the way in -lrb- again , refer to the truth b tell show review -rrb- . it feel more like a carbine , which be not ideal . a better design would have be a small smg or pistol rifle configuration for the hardcore gamer . this would have enable the gamer to use the device in a more relax position for a longer play time . what i have do be hack-sawed the stock ... or you can disassemble and remove it if you do not feel like destroy the sharp shooter . it feel much more comfortable this way . with these point make , i can not recommend this for anyone serious about gaming . let i put it this way . if you be go up against someone with a dual shock controller or bare p move\/navigator combo , you will get 0wned big time on multi-player . but it be fun for single-player or campaign . game ... there be only a few that utilize this attachment . and some developer do not learn the lesson that wii developer go through . they be make the same mistake for controller function and camera control . sometimes , i feel like ask , `` do not they at least play link 's crossbow training ? '' . ... it will take sony developer awhile since they be `` re-invent '' the wheel , or the zapper in this instance . but i be sure thing will get better , at least on par like high voltage software 's `` the conduit '' and its ' implementation , down the road .
321	Video_Games	NEG	1	this game be very stupid and pointless . i would not give it any star if i could . this game be a waist of money , heck they should be pay you . i give this game -5 star hope this review will help someone . that be not all the animation be bad and the plot be childish !
886	Video_Games	NEG	2	in short . this be a lot of cut scene , occasionally interupt by a game . if i just want to sit back and watch , i would have rent amovie . ban all cut scene .
487	Video_Games	NEG	1	i purchase this game after have be deceive by the hype -lrb- the realism -rrb- and i be very much disappointed ... to the point i will likely never purchase anything make by ea again . first of all , they have do away with prone completely . how many soldier refuse to `` hit the deck '' when they be under fire ? that be strike one against this supposedly realistic game . the mission game be too simple ... 4 hour to beat if you be a noobie . the graphic have problem -lrb- lot of tear -rrb- as well as the multi-player have severe spawn issue -lrb- they respawn you into the same place every time so sniper can rack up kill easily -rrb- . additionally , the server for the multi-player seem to crash all the time . then recently they make change to the game in which a full on , dead center mass shot from a sniper rifle will not kill , but only wind a player . additionally , you can shoot they in the head and we still do not have a confirm kill every time . save you money , wait for the next round of game to come out , and then rent they first to make sure they do not suck like this one do . i be not happy about be out the $ 60 and to tell you how bad it be , gamestop as well as most other company have stop buy they back because they have so many sellback .
649	Video_Games	NEG	1	first of all the device i get be not the genuine product it be some chinese knock off which do not even work . the mere fact that it will cost i more than the value of the device to send it back be a damn shame ill know better next time
680	Video_Games	NEG	1	this game be not worth the hassle , the drm punish customer by make the game unusable . also , the game itself be very shallow and do not live up to the massive hype . avoid this one like the plague .
112	Video_Games	NEG	1	do not waste you money on this bomb . ea do it once again . lack of control , can not understand anything be say , no story line and after two day i have have enough of the garbage ea send this way . never will buy another ea game . should have spend advertise money on make this game work .
276	Video_Games	NEG	1	i be so mad to amazon because i order this a month ago but i still have not receive it . i be not satisfy as a customer .
451	Video_Games	NEG	2	i have a high end system with a geforce 6800 nvidia video card , and the game have many error . at first i have to run the game with low video setting to avoid the `` directx unrecoverable error '' . then , i have to run it in safe mode to avoid the error . the tech support have many thing to try and be baffle at why the error be still occur on my high end system . about half way through the game the error still come up even in safe mode !! the gameplay be predictable , but still fun at time . i would wait til the price drop to about $ 20 to buy it ...
342	Video_Games	NEG	1	i wish i have read the review more closely before purchase skyrim for a windows pc . i have a top of the line win7 professional machine with a i7 processor , 12 gb of ram and a very good graphic card -lrb- not top of the line , but darn good -rrb- . the graphic in skyrim look amazing , but the damn mouse movement suck ! it be herky-jerkey and nearly impossible to control . it overshoot , undercut and make movement seem like you character be a drunk amble down the street . it literally hurt my eye and have give i a headache . i simply can not play the game . i give up . the rest of you have fun ... i be simply too old for this crap !
